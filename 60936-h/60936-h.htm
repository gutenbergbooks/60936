<h2>NOTE BY THE EDITORS</h2>

<p>The purpose of <i>The Cambridge Handbooks of
Liturgical Study</i> is to offer to students who
are entering upon the study of Liturgies such help
as may enable them to proceed with advantage to
the use of the larger and more technical works upon
the subject which are already at their service.</p>

<p>The series will treat of the history and rationale
of the several rites and ceremonies which have found
a place in Christian worship, with some account of
the ancient liturgical books in which they are
contained. Attention will also be called to the importance
which liturgical forms possess as expressions
of Christian conceptions and beliefs.</p>

<p>Each volume will provide a list or lists of the
books in which the study of its subject may be
pursued, and will contain a table of Contents and
an Index.</p>

<p>The editors do not hold themselves responsible
for the opinions expressed in the several volumes
of the series. While offering suggestions on points
of detail, they have left each writer to treat his
subject in his own way, regard being had to the
general plan and purpose of the series.</p>

<p>[The manuscript of the present volume was sent to
the press only a few weeks before the lamented death of
the author, and therefore the work did not receive final
revision at his hands. In its original draft the manuscript
contained a somewhat fuller discussion of some of the
topics handled, <i>e.g.</i> the work of the mediaeval computists,
and such technical terms as ‘Sunday Letters,’ ‘Epacts,’
etc., as well as a fuller treatment of the various Eastern
Kalendars. Exigencies of space, however, and the scope
of the present series, made it necessary for the author
to curtail these portions of his work, while suggesting
books in which the study of these topics may be pursued
by the student. The Editors have endeavoured, as far
as possible, to verify the references and to supplement
them, where it seemed necessary to do so. In a few
cases they have added short additional notes, enclosed
in brackets, and bearing an indication that they are the
work of the Editors.]</p>

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The Church’s Year, as it has been known for many
centuries throughout Christendom, is characterised,
first, by the weekly festival of the Lord’s Day (a
feature which dates from the dawn of the Church’s
life and the age of the Apostles) and, secondly, by
the annual recurrence of fasts and festivals, of certain
days and certain seasons of religious observance.
These latter emerged, and came to find places in the
Kalendar at various periods.</p>

<p>In order of time the season of the Pascha, the
commemoration of the death, and, subsequently, of
the resurrection of the Saviour, is the first of the
annual observances to appear in history. Again, at
an early date local commemorations of the deaths of
victims of the great persecutions under the pagan
Emperors were observed yearly. And some of these
(notably those who suffered at Rome) gradually gained
positions in the Church’s Year in regions remote from
the places of their origin. Speaking generally, little
as it might be thought probable beforehand, it is
a fact that martyrs of local celebrity emerge in the
history of the Kalendar at an earlier date than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
but the most eminent of the Apostles (who were
also martyrs), and earlier than some of the festivals
of the Lord Himself. The Kalendar had its origin
in the historical events of the martyrdoms.</p>

<p>So far the growth of the Kalendar was the outcome
of natural and spontaneous feeling. But at a
later time we have manifest indications of artificial
constructiveness, the laboured studies of the cloister,
and the work of professional martyrologists and
Kalendar-makers. To take, for the purpose of
illustration, an extreme case, it is obvious that the
assignment of days in the Kalendar of the Eastern
Church to Trophimus, Sosipater and Erastus, Philemon
and Archippus, Onesimus, Agabus, Rufus, Asyncretus,
Phlegon, Hermas, the woman of Samaria
(to whom the name Photina was given), and other
persons whose names occur in the New Testament,
is the outcome of deliberate and elaborate constructiveness.
The same is true of the days of Old Testament
Patriarchs and Prophets, once, in a measure, a feature
of Western, as they are still of Eastern Kalendars.
But even all the festivals of our Lord, save the Pascha,
though doubtless suggested by a spontaneous feeling
of reverence, could be assigned to particular days of
the year only after some processes of investigation
and inference, or of conjecture. Whether the birthday
of the Founder of the Christian religion should
be placed on January 6 or on December 25 was a
matter of debate and argument. Commentators on
the history of the Gospels, the conjectures of interpreters
of Old Testament prophecy, and such information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
as might be fancied to be derivable from ancient
annals, had of necessity to be considered. The
assignment of the feast of the Nativity to a particular
day was a product of the reflective and constructive
spirit.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely impossible that ancient
tradition, if not actual record, may be the source
of June 29 being assigned for the martyrdom of
St Peter and St Paul; but a more probable origin of
the date is that it marks the translation of relics.
Certainly the days of most of the Apostles (considered
as the days of their martyrdoms) have little or no
support from sources that have any claim to be
regarded as historical. They find their places but
gradually, and, it would seem, as the result of a
resolve that none of them should be forgotten.</p>

<p>Commemorations which mark the definition of a
dogma, or which originated in the special emphasis
given at some particular epoch to certain aspects of
popular belief and sentiment, have all appeared at
times well within the ken of the historical student.
Thus, ‘Orthodoxy Sunday’ (the first Sunday in Lent)
in the Kalendar of the Greek Church is but little
concerned with the controversies on the right faith
which occupied the great Councils of the fourth and
fifth centuries. It commemorates the triumph of the
party that secured the use of images over the
iconoclasts; this was the ‘orthodoxy’ which was
chiefly celebrated; and we can fix the date of the
establishment of the festival as <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 842. Again, the
commemoration of All Souls in the West was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
outcome of a growing sense of the need of prayers
and masses on behalf of the faithful departed. The
ninth century shows traces of the observance of some
such day; but it was not till the close of the tenth
century, under the special impetus supplied by the
reported visions of a pilgrim from Jerusalem, who
declared that he had seen the tortures of the souls
suffering purgatorial fire, that the observance made
headway. We then find Nov. 2 assigned for the
festival, which came to be gradually and slowly
adopted. The feast of Corpus Christi, which now
figures so largely in the popular devotions of several
countries of Europe, and is marked as a ‘double of
the first class’ in the service-books of the Church of
Rome, emerges for the first time in the thirteenth
century, and was not formally enjoined till the
fourteenth. The feast of the Conception of St Mary
the Virgin seems to have originated in the East, and
to have been simply a historical commemoration, even
as the Greeks commemorate the conception of St John
the Baptist. The Eastern tradition represents Anna
as barren and well stricken in years, when, in answer
to her prayers and those of Joachim her spouse, God
revealed to them by an angel that they should have a
child. This conception was according to the Greek
Menology ‘contrary to the laws of nature,’ like that
of the Baptist. In the West the festival of the
Conception appears at the end of the eleventh or
beginning of the twelfth century. The controversies
as to its doctrinal significance form part of the history
of dogma, and are full of instruction: but they cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
be considered here. Up to the year 1854 the name
of the festival in the Kalendars of the authorised
service-books of the Roman Church was simply
<i>Conceptio B. Mariae Virginis</i>. It was as recently as
Dec. 8, 1854, by an ordinance of Pope Pius IX, that
the name was changed into <i>Immaculata Conceptio
B. Mariae Virginis</i>. It will thus be seen how
changes in the Kalendar illustrate the changes and
accretions of dogma, facts which are further exhibited
by the changes in the rank and dignity of festivals of
this kind, at first only tolerated perhaps, and of local
usage, but eventually enjoined as of universal
obligation, and elevated in the order and grade of
festal classification. Again, the considerable number
of festivals of the Greek and Russian Churches
connected with relics and wonder-working <i>icons</i> throws
a light on the intellectual standpoint and the current
beliefs in these ancient branches of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>Not less instructive in exhibiting the extraordinary
growth in the <i>cultus</i> of the Blessed Virgin in the
West are the inferences which may be gathered from
a knowledge of the fact that no festival of the Virgin
was celebrated in the Church of Rome before the
seventh century, when we compare the crowd of festivals,
major and minor, devoted to the Virgin in the
Roman Kalendar of to-day. But considerations of this
kind are only incidentally touched on in the following
pages; and they are referred to here simply with a
view to show that the study of the Kalendar is not an
enquiry interesting merely to dry-as-dust antiquaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
but one which is intimately connected with the study
of the history of belief, and is inwoven with far-reaching
issues.</p>

<p>In the enquiry into the origins of ecclesiastical
observances the discovery within recent years of early
documents, hitherto unknown in modern days, enforces
the obvious thought that our conceptions on
such subjects must be liable to re-adjustment from
time to time in the light of new evidence. Until the
day comes, if it ever comes, when it can be said with
truth that the materials supplied by the early
manuscripts of the East and West have been exhausted,
there can be no finality. The document
discovered some ten or twelve years ago, in which a
lady from Gaul or Spain, who had gone on pilgrimage
to the East, records her impressions of religious
observances which she had witnessed at Jerusalem
towards the close of the fourth century, has furnished
some important light on the subject before us, as
well as on the history of ceremonial. In the following
pages this document is referred to as the <i>Pilgrimage
of Silvia</i> (‘Peregrinatio Silviae’), without prejudice
to the question relating to the true name of the
writer. The period when the work was written is the
important question for our purposes; and those who
are most competent to express an opinion consider
that it belongs to the time of Theodosius the Great,
and to a date between the years 383 and 394.</p>

<p>The influence of the early mediaeval martyrologists,
Bede, Florus, Ado, and Usuard, upon the mediaeval
Kalendars, is unquestionable; but the relations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
their works to one another, the variations of the
different recensions and the sources from which they
were drawn, are still subjects of investigation. In
addition to the brief notices of the martyrologists
which will be found in the following pages, the
enquirer who desires further information should not
fail to study with care the recent treatise of Dom
Henri Quentin, of Solesmes, <i>Les Martyrologes
historiques</i>.</p>

<p>Of necessity a general outline sketch of the
formation of the Kalendar is all that can be attempted
in the following pages. Local Kalendars, more
especially, for most of our readers, those of the
service-books of England, Scotland, and Ireland,
present many interesting and attractive features;
but it has been impossible to deal with them in an
adequate manner. Some space has, however, been
devoted to the consideration of the Kalendar and
Ecclesiastical Year of the Orthodox Church of the East,
including the peculiar arrangement of the grouping of
Sundays; and brief notices are given of the fasts and
festivals of some of the separated Churches of the East.</p>

<p>The questions concerning the determination of
Easter will form the main trial of the patience of the
student.</p>

<p>The early controversies on the Paschal question
are not free from obscurity; and the interests attaching
to the construction of the various systems of cycles,
intended to form a perpetual table for the unerring
determination of the date of Easter, are mainly the
interests which are awakened by the history of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
ingenuity grappling more or less successfully with
a problem which called for astronomical knowledge
and mathematical skill. Religious interests are not
touched even remotely. Profound as are the thoughts
and emotions which cluster around the commemoration
of the Lord’s Resurrection, they are quite independent
of any considerations connected with the age of the
moon and the date of the vernal equinox. The
scheme for a time seriously entertained by Gregory
XIII of making the celebration of Easter to fall on a
fixed Sunday, the same in every year, has much to
commend it. Had it been adopted we should, at all
events, have been spared many practical inconveniences,
and the ecclesiastical computists would
have been saved a vast amount of labour. But we
must take things as they are.</p>

<p>If anyone contends that the safest ‘Rule for
finding Easter’ is ‘Buy a penny almanack,’ I give in
a ready assent. It has in principle high ecclesiastical
precedent; for it was exactly the same reasonable
plan of accepting the determinations of those whom
one has good reason to think competent authorities,
which in ancient times made the Christian world
await the pronouncements as to the date of Easter
which came year by year from the Patriarchs of
Alexandria in their Paschal Epistles: while for the
date of Easter in any particular year in the distant
past, or in the future, there are few who will not
prefer the Tables supplied in such works as <i>L’Art de
vérifier les Dates</i>, or Mas Latrie’s <i>Trésor de Chronologie</i>,
to any calculations of their own, based on the Golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
Numbers and Sunday Letters<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. In the present
volume the limits of space forbid any detailed discussion
of the principles involved and the methods
employed in the determination of Easter by the
computists both ancient and modern. A brief
historical sketch of the successive reforms of the
Kalendar is all that has been found possible. Those
who seek for fuller information can resort to the
treatises mentioned above or in the course of the
volume. The chapter on Easter has for convenience
been placed near the conclusion of this volume.</p>

<p>In dealing with both Eastern and Western Kalendars
the student will bear in mind that only comparatively
few of the festivals affected the life of the great
body of the faithful. A very large number of festivals
were marked in the services of the Church by certain
liturgical changes or additions. Many of them had
their special <i>propria</i>; others were grouped in classes;
and each class had its own special liturgical features.
Only comparatively few made themselves felt outside
the walls of the churches. Some of them carried a
cessation from servile labour, or caused the closing of
the law courts, or, as chiefly in the Greek Church,
mitigated in various degrees (according to the dignity
of the festival) the rigour of fasting. The distinction
between <i>festa chori</i> and <i>festa fori</i> is always worthy of
observation. A relic of the distinction is preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
in an expression of common currency in France, when
one speaks of a person as of insignificant importance,
<i>C’est un saint qu’on ne chôme pas</i>.</p>

<p>Although the general scope of the following pages
is wide in intention, the origins of the Kalendar and
the rise of the principal seasons and days of observance
have chiefly attracted the interest of the writer.
Later developments are not wholly neglected, but
they occupy a subordinate place.</p>

<p>The enactments of civil legislation under the
Christian Emperors and other rulers, in respect to
the observance of Sunday and other Christian holy
days, is an interesting field of study; but it has been
impossible to enter upon it here in view of the limits
of space at our disposal.</p>

<p>The study of Kalendars brings one into constant
contact with hagiology, the acts of martyrs, and the
lives of saints. It would however have been obviously
vain to deal seriously in the present volume with so
vast a subject, even in broadest outline.</p>

serviceable works dealing with various branches of the
subject before us is prefixed.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WEEK</span></h2>

<p>The Church of Christ, founded in Judaea by Him
who, after the flesh, was of the family of David, and
advanced and guided in its earlier years by leaders
of Jewish descent, could not fail to bear traces of
its Hebrew origin. The attitude and trend of minds
that had been long familiar with the religious polity
of the Hebrews, and with the worship of the Temple
and the Synagogue, showed themselves in the institutions
and worship of the early Church. This truth
is observable to some extent in the Church’s polity
and scheme of government, and even more clearly in
the methods and forms of its liturgical worship. It
is not then to be wondered at that the same influences
were at work in the ordering of the times and seasons,
the fasts and festivals, of the Church’s year.</p>

<h3><i>The Week and the Lord’s Day.</i></h3>

<p>Most potent in affecting the whole daily life of
Christendom in all ages was the passing on from
Judaism of the Week of seven days. Inwoven, as it
is, with the history of our lives, and taken very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
as matter of course, as if it were something like a
law of nature, the dominating influence and far
reaching effects of this seven-day division of time are
seldom fully realised.</p>

<p>The Week, known in the Roman world at the
time of our Lord only in connexion with the obscure
speculations of Eastern astrology, or as a feature, in
its Sabbath, of the lives of the widely-spread Jewish
settlers in the great cities of the Empire, had been
from remote times accepted among various oriental
peoples. It would be outside our province to enquire
into its origin, though much can be said in favour of
the view that it took its rise out of a rough division
into four of the lunar month. But, so far as Christianity
is concerned, it is enough to know that it was
beyond all doubt taken over from the religion of the
Hebrews.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that at the outset some of the
Christian converts from Judaism may have continued
to observe the Jewish Sabbath, the seventh or last
day of the week: and that attempts were made to
fasten its obligations upon Gentile converts is evident
from St Paul’s Epistle to the Colossians (ii. 16).
But it is certain that at an early date among Christians
the first day of the week was marked by special
religious observances. The testimony of the Acts of
the Apostles and the Epistles of St Paul shows us
the first day of the week as a time for the assembling
of Christians for instruction and for worship, when
‘the breaking of bread’ formed part of the service,
and when offerings for charitable and religious purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
might be laid up in store<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. The name ‘the
Lord’s day,’ applied to the first day of the week, may
probably be traced to New Testament times. The
occurrence of the expression in the Revelation of
St John (i. 10) has been commonly regarded as a
testimony to this application<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Epistle of Barnabas</i> (tentatively assigned
by Bishop Lightfoot to between <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 70 and 79, and
by others to about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 130-131) we find the passage
(c. 15), ‘We keep the eighth day for rejoicing, in the
which also Jesus rose from the dead.’ The date of
the <i>Teaching of the Apostles</i> is still reckoned by
some scholars as <i>sub judice</i>. But, if it is rightly
assigned to the first century, its testimony may be
cited here. In it is the following passage:—‘On
the Lord’s own day (κατὰ κυριακὴν δὲ Κυρίον) gather
yourselves together and break bread, and give thanks,
first confessing your transgressions, that your sacrifice
may be pure’ (c. 14).</p>

<p>The next evidence, in point of time, is a passage
in the <i>Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians</i> (cc. 8, 9,
10), in which the writer dissuades those to whom he
wrote from observing sabbaths (μηκέτι σαββατίζοντες)
and urges them to live ‘according to the Lord’s day
(κατὰ κυριακὴν) on which our life also rose through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Him.’ It is impossible to suppose that in early times
the Lord’s day was held to be a day of rest. The
work of the servant and labouring class had to be
done; and it has been reasonably conjectured that
the assemblies of Christians before dawn were to meet
the necessities of the situation. Lastly, the passage
from the <i>Apology</i> of Justin Martyr (<i>Ap.</i> i. 67) is too
well known to be cited in full. He describes to the
Emperor the character and procedure of the Christian
assemblies on ‘the day of the sun,’ which we know from
other sources to have been the first day of the week.
Writings of the Apostles or of the Prophets were
read: the President of the assembly instructed and
exhorted: bread, and wine and water were consecrated
and distributed to those present and sent by the
Deacons to the absent: alms were collected and
deposited with the President for the relief of widows
and orphans, the sick and the poor, prisoners and
strangers. Later than Justin we need not go, as the
evidence from all quarters pours in abundantly to
establish the universal observance of ‘the first day of
the week,’ ‘Sunday,’ ‘the Lord’s day,’ as a day for
worship and religious instruction<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<h3><i>The Sabbath (Saturday).</i></h3>

<p>Lack of positive evidence prevents us from speaking
with any certainty as to whether there was among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Christians any recognised and approved observance
of Saturday (the Sabbath) in the first, second and
third centuries. There is no hint of such observance
in early Christian literature; and there are passages
which rather go to discountenance the notion<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>Duchesne, whose opinion deservedly carries much
weight, comes to the conclusion that the observance
of Saturday in the fourth century was not a survival
of an attempt of primitive times to effect a conciliation
between Jewish and Christian practices, but an institution
of comparatively late date<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. Certainly one
cannot speak confidently of the existence of Saturday
as a day of religious observance among Christians
before the fourth century.</p>

<p>Epiphanius<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, in the second half of the fourth
century, speaks of synaxes being held <i>in some places</i>
on the Sabbath; from which it may probably be
inferred that it was not so in his time in Cyprus.</p>

<p>In the Canons of the Council of Laodicea (which
can hardly be placed earlier than about the middle of
the fourth century, and is probably later) we find it
enjoined that ‘on the Sabbath the Gospels with other
Scriptures shall be read’ (16); that ‘in Lent bread
ought not to be offered, save only on the Sabbath
and the Lord’s day’ (49); and that ‘in Lent the
feasts of martyrs should not be kept, but that a
commemoration of the holy martyrs should be made
on Sabbaths and Lord’s days’ (50). Yet it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
forbidden ‘to Judaize and be idle on the Sabbath,’
while, ‘if they can,’ Christians are directed to rest
on the Lord’s day. The <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> go
further; and, under the names of St Peter and St
Paul, it is enjoined that servants should work only
five days in the week, and be free from labour on the
Sabbath and the Lord’s day ‘with a view to the
teaching of godliness’ (viii. 33). Uncertain as are
the date and origin of the <i>Constitutions</i> they may be
regarded as in some measure reflecting the general
sentiment in the East in the fifth, or possibly the
close of the fourth century<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. From these testimonies
it appears that the Sabbath was a day of special
religious observance, and that in the East it partook
of a festal character. Falling in with this way
of regarding Saturday we find Canon 64 of the
so-called <i>Apostolic Canons</i> (of uncertain date, but
possibly early in the fifth century<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>) declaring, ‘If
any cleric be found fasting on the Lord’s day, or
on the Sabbath, except one only [that is, doubtless
“the Great Sabbath,” or Easter Eve], let him be
deprived, and, if he be a layman, let him be segregated<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.’
The <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i> emphasise the
position of the Sabbath by the exhortation that
Christians should ‘gather together especially on the
Sabbath, and on the Lord’s day, the day of the
Resurrection’ (ii. 59); and again, ‘Keep the Sabbath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and the Lord’s day as feasts, for the one is the
commemoration of the Creation, the other of the
Resurrection’ (vii. 23³). We find also that one of
the canons of Laodicea referred to above is in substance
re-enacted at a much later date by the Council
in Trullo (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 692) in this form, that except on
the Sabbath, the Lord’s day, and the Feast of the
Annunciation, the Liturgy of the Pre-sanctified should
be said on all days in Lent (c. 52).</p>

<p>In the city of Alexandria in the time of the
historian Socrates the Eucharist was not celebrated
on Saturday; but other parts of Egypt followed the
general practice of the East. Socrates says that
Rome agreed with Alexandria in this respect<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>It is certain that very commonly, though not
universally, in the East the Sabbath was regarded
as possessing the features of a weekly festival (with
a eucharistic celebration) second in importance only
to the Lord’s day. And Gregory of Nyssa says, ‘If
thou hast despised the Sabbath, with what face wilt
thou dare to behold the Lord’s day.... They are
sister days’ (<i>de Castigatione</i>, Migne, <i>P.G.</i> xlvi. 309).</p>

<p>In the West we find also that the Sabbath was a
day of special religious observance; but there was a
variety of local usage in regard to the mode of its
observance. At Rome the Sabbath was a fast-day in
the time of St Augustine<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; and the same is true of
some other places; but the majority of the Western
Churches, like the East, did not so regard it. In
North Africa there was a variety of practice, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
places observed the day as a fast, others as a feast.
At Milan the day was not treated as a fast; and
St Ambrose, in reply to a question put by Augustine
at the instance of his mother Monnica, stated that
he regarded the matter as one of local discipline, and
gave the sensible rule to do in such matters at Rome
as the Romans do<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. In the early part of the fourth
century the Spanish Council of Elvira corrected the
error that every Sabbath should be observed as a
fast<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<p>As to the origin of the Saturday fast we are left
almost wholly to conjecture. It has been supposed
by some to be an exhibition of antagonism to Judaism,
which regarded the Sabbath as a festival; while others
consider that it is a continuation of the Friday fast,
as a kind of preparatory vigil of the Lord’s day. It
is outside our scope to go into this question.</p>

<p>A relic of the ancient position of distinction
occupied by Saturday may perhaps be found in the
persistence of the name ‘Sabbatum’ in the Western
service-books. Abstinence (from flesh) continued,
‘de mandate ecclesiae,’ on Saturdays in the Roman
Church. For Roman Catholics in England it ceased
in 1830 by authority of Pope Pius VIII.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>This seems a convenient place for saying something as
to the use of the word <i>Feria</i> in ecclesiastical language to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
designate an ordinary week-day. The names most commonly
given to the days of the week in the service-books
and other ecclesiastical records are ‘Dies Dominica’ (rarely
‘Dominicus’) for the Lord’s Day, or Sunday; ‘Feria II’
for Monday; ‘Feria III’ for Tuesday, and so on to Saturday
which (with rare exceptions) is not Feria VII but
‘Sabbatum.’</p>

<p>Why the ordinary week-day is called ‘Feria,’ when in
classical Latin ‘feriae’ was used for ‘days of rest,’ ‘holidays,’
‘festivals,’ is a question that cannot be answered with any
confidence. A conjecture which seems open to various
objections, though it has found supporters, is as follows:
all the days of Easter week were holidays, ‘feriatae’; and,
this being the first week of the ecclesiastical year, the
other weeks followed the mode of naming the days which
had been used in regard to the first week. A fatal objection
to this theory, for which the authority of St Jerome has
been claimed, is that we find ‘feria’ used, as in Tertullian,
for an ordinary week-day long before we have any reason
to think that there was any ordinance for the observance
of the whole of Easter week by a cessation from labour<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>Another conjecture, presented however with too much
confidence, is that put forward on the authority of Isidore
of Seville<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> by the learned Henri de Valois (Valesius). He
alleges that the ancient Christians, receiving, as they did,
the week of seven days from the Jews, imitated the Jewish
practice, which used the expression ‘the second of the
Sabbath,’ ‘the third of the Sabbath,’ and so on for the
days of the week: that ‘Feria’ means a day of rest, in
effect the same as ‘Sabbath,’ and that in this way the
‘second Feria’ and ‘third Feria,’ etc., came to be used for
the second and third days of the week<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The astrological names for the days of the week, as of
the Sun, of the Moon, of Mars, of Mercury, etc., were
generally avoided by Christians; but they are not wholly
unknown in Christian writers, and sometimes appear even
in Christian epitaphs.</p>

<p>In the ecclesiastical records of the Greeks the first
day of the week is ‘the Lord’s day’; and the seventh,
the Sabbath, as in the West. But Friday is <i>Parasceve</i>
(παρασκευή), a name which in the Latin Church is confined
to one Friday in the year, the Friday of the Lord’s
Passion, which day in the Eastern Church is known as
‘the Great Parasceve.’ With these exceptions the days
of the week are ‘the second,’ ‘the third,’ ‘the fourth,’ etc.,
the word ‘day’ being understood.</p>

<p>It is worth recording that among the Portuguese the
current names for the week-days are: <i>segunda feira</i>, <i>terça
feira</i>, etc.</p>

</div>

<h3><i>Wednesday and Friday.</i></h3>

<p>Long prior to any clear evidence for the special
observance among Christians of the last day of the
week we find testimonies to a religious character
attaching to the fourth and sixth days.</p>

<p>The devout Jews were accustomed to observe a
fast twice a week, on the second and fifth days,
Monday and Thursday<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>; and these days, together
with the Christian fasts substituted for them, are
referred to in the <i>Teaching of the Apostles</i> (8), ‘Let
not your fastings be with the hypocrites, for they fast
on the second and fifth day of the week; but do ye
keep your fast on the fourth and parasceve (the
sixth).’ In the <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i> we find the
writer relating that he was fasting and holding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<i>station</i><a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. And this peculiar term is applied by
Tertullian to fasts (whether partial or entire we need
not here discuss) observed on the fourth and sixth
days of the week<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>. Clement of Alexandria, though
not using the word <i>station</i>, speaks of fasts being held
on the fourth day of the week and on the parasceve<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<p>At a much later date than the authorities cited
above we find the <i>Apostolic Canons</i> decreeing under
severe penalties that, unless for reasons of bodily
infirmity, not only the clergy but the laity must fast
on the fourth day of the week and on the sixth
(<i>parasceve</i>). And the rule of fasting on Wednesdays
and Fridays still obtains in the Eastern Church<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>These two days were marked by the assembling
of Christians for worship. But the character of the
service was not everywhere the same. Duchesne<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
has exhibited the facts thus: In Africa in the time of
Tertullian the Eucharist was celebrated, and it was
so at Jerusalem towards the close of the fourth
century. In the Church of Alexandria the Eucharist
was not celebrated on these days; but the Scriptures
were read and interpreted. And in this matter, as
in many others, the Church at Rome probably agreed
with Alexandria. It is certain, at least as regards
Friday, that the mysteries were not publicly celebrated
on these days at Rome about the beginning
of the fifth century. The observance of Friday as
a day of abstinence is still of obligation in the West.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">DAYS OF THE MARTYRS</span></h2>

<p>We now pass from features of every week to days
and seasons of yearly occurrence.</p>

<p>In point of time the celebrations connected with
the Pascha are the earliest to emerge of sacred days
observed annually by the whole Church. But for
reasons of convenience it has been thought better to
defer the consideration of the difficult questions
relating to the Easter controversies till the origin of
the days of Martyrs and Saints has been dealt with.</p>

<p>The Kalendar in some of its later stages exhibits
a highly artificial elaboration. But in its beginnings it
was, to a large extent, the outcome of a natural and
spontaneous feeling which could not fail to remember
in various localities the cruel deaths of men and
women who had suffered for the Faith with courage
and constancy in such places, or their neighbourhoods.
The origins of the Kalendar show in various churches,
widely separated, the natural desire to commemorate
their own local martyrs on the days on which they
had actually suffered.</p>

<p>As regards the order of time there is ample reason
to convince us that the commemorations of martyrs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
were features of Church life much earlier than those
of St Mary the Virgin, of most of the Apostles, and
even of many of the festivals of the Lord Himself.</p>

<p>The marks of antiquity that characterise generally
the older Kalendars and Martyrologies are (1) the
comparative paucity of entries, (2) the fewness of
festivals of the Virgin, (3) the fewness of saints who
were not martyrs, (4) the absence of the title ‘saint,’
and (5) the absence of feasts in Lent.</p>

<p>Again, the local character of the observance of the
days of martyrs is a marked feature of the earlier
records which illustrate the subject. Now and then
the name of some martyr of pre-eminent distinction
in other lands finds its way into the lists; but it
remains generally true that in each place the martyrs
and saints of that place and its neighbourhood form
the great body of those commemorated. And in
addition to the natural feeling that prompted the
remembrance of those more particularly associated
with a particular place, the fact that the commemorations
were originally observed by religious services
in cemeteries, at the tombs or burial places of the
martyrs, tended at first to discountenance the commemoration
of the martyrs of other places whose
story was known only by report, whether written
or oral.</p>

<p>The day of a martyr’s death was by an exercise
of the triumphant faith of the Church known as his
birthday (<i>natale</i>, or <i>dies natalis</i>, or <i>natalitia</i>). It
was regarded as the day of his entrance into a new
and better world. The expression occurs in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Greek form as early as the letter of the Church of
Smyrna concerning the martyrdom of Polycarp (<i>c.</i> 18).</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that at an early date
records were kept of the day of the death of martyrs.
Cyprian required that even the death-days of those
who died in prison for the faith should be communicated
to him with a view to his offering an oblation
on that day (<i>Ep.</i> xii. (xxxvii.) 2). It is in this way
probably that the earliest Kalendars of the Church
originated.</p>

plate shows the entries from St Stephen’s Day to Epiphany.</p>
</div>

<p>We purpose dealing more particularly with the
early Roman Kalendars. The earliest martyrology
that has survived is contained in a Roman record
transcribed in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 354. It is known, sometimes as
the <i>Liberian Martyrology</i> (from the name of Liberius,
who was bishop of Rome at the time), sometimes as
the <i>Bucherian Martyrology</i>, from the name of the
scholar who first made it known to the learned world<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>,
and not uncommonly as the <i>Philocalian</i>, from the
name of the scribe. It presents many interesting,
and some perplexing features, which cannot be dealt
with here. We must content ourselves with noticing
that, besides recording, as in a serviceable almanack,
several pagan festivals, it marks the days of the month
of the burials (<i>depositiones</i>) of the bishops of Rome
from <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 254 to <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 354, and also the burial-days of
martyrs, twenty-five in number. In both lists the
cemeteries at Rome where the burials took place are
noted. But there are also entered three ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
commemorations which do not mark entombments,
(1) ‘viij Kal. Jan. (Dec. 25) Natus Christus in
Bethleem Judeae’; (2) ‘viij Kal. Mart. (Feb. 22)
Natale (<i>sic</i>) Petri de Cathedra’; (3) ‘Nonis Martii
(March 7) Perpetuae et Felicitatis Africae<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.’ The
appearance of St Perpetua and St Felicitas in a
characteristically Roman document is a striking
testimony to the fame of these two African sufferers
for the Faith<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>. The use of the word <i>natale</i> in
connexion with St Peter’s chair not improbably marks
the dedication of a church; and, at all events at
a later period, the word seems sometimes used as
equivalent simply to a festival, or perhaps a festival
marking an origin or beginning—as, for example,
<i>Natale Calicis</i>, of which something will be said hereafter
(p. 40). Easter could not appear in the Kalendar
properly so-called; but the document contains cycles
for the calculation of Easter, and a list of the days on
which it would fall from <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 312 to <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 412.</p>

<p>Early Kalendars would be of much value in our
enquiries; but they are few in number. The following
three deserve notice. (1) The <i>Syrian Martyrology</i>
first published by Dr W. Wright in the <i>Journal of
Sacred Literature</i> (Oct. 1866). It was written in
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 411-12, but represents an original of perhaps
about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 380. It is Arian in origin, and has
elements that show connexions with Alexandria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Antioch, and Nicomedia; and its range of martyrs
is much wider than that of other early documents
of the kind. Yet of Western martyrs we find only
in Africa Perpetua and Satornilos and ten other
martyrs<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> (March 7) and ‘Akistus (?Xystus II) bishop
of Rome’ (Aug. 1). We find St Peter and St Paul
on Dec. 28; St John and St James on Dec. 27; and
‘St Stephen, apostle’ on the 26th<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. (2) The <i>Kalendar
of Polemius Silvius</i>, bishop of Sedunum, in the upper
valley of the Rhone (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 448). It contains the
birthdays of the Emperors and some of the more
eminent of the heathen festivals, such as the Lupercalia
and Caristia, but with a view, apparently, of
supplanting them by Christian commemorations. The
Christian festivals recorded are few in number, those
of our Lord being Christmas, Epiphany, and the fixed
dates, March 25 for the Crucifixion, and March 27
for the Resurrection. There are only six saints’ days.
The <i>depositio</i> of Peter and Paul on Feb. 22; Vincent,
Lawrence, Hippolytus, Stephen, and the Maccabees
on their usual days. Other features of interest must
be passed over<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. (3) The <i>Carthaginian Kalendar</i><a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
has been assigned as probably about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 500<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
is thus described by Bishop J. Wordsworth, ‘It
has, in the Eastern manner, no entries between
February 16 and April 19, <i>i.e.</i> during Lent. Its
Saints are mostly local, but some twenty are Roman,
and a few other Italian, Sicilian, and Spanish. It
also marks SS. John Baptist (June 24), Maccabees,
Luke [Oct. 13], Andrew, Christmas, Stephen [Dec. 26],
John Baptist [probably an error of the pen for John
the Evangelist] and James (Dec. 27) [‘the Apostle
whom Herod slew’], Infants [Dec. 28] and Epiphany
[sanctum Epefania]<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>.’ It may be added that this
Kalendar marks the <i>depositiones</i> of seven bishops of
Carthage, not martyrs, whose anniversaries were kept.</p>

<p>In one of the African Councils of the fourth
century it was enacted that the Acts of the martyrs
should be read in the church on their anniversaries.
But Rome was slow in adopting this practice<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</p>

<p>It will be seen that as time went on the strictly
local character of the martyrs commemorated was
invaded by a desire to record the famous sufferers of
other parts of the Christian world. Rome, with its
characteristic conservatism in matters liturgical, seems
to have been slower than other places to yield to this
impulse. At Hippo we find Augustine commemorating,
beside local martyrs, the Roman Lawrence and
Agnes, the Spanish Vincent and Fructuosus, and the
Milanese Protasius and Gervasius whose bones (as
was believed) had been recently discovered. He also
commemorated the Maccabees, St Stephen, and both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the Nativity and Decollation of the Baptist. On the
other hand in the laudatory sermons that have come
down to us we find Chrysostom at Antioch commemorating
only the saints of Antioch, and Basil, at
Caesarea in Cappadocia, only those of his own
country.</p>

<p>The Sacramentary, which is called after Pope Leo
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 440-461), shows signs of a somewhat later date;
but it is unquestionably a Roman book; and the
Kalendar which we can construct from it represents
the Kalendar of Rome as it was not later than about
the middle of the sixth century. It gives us the
following days; but it must be observed that the
months of January, February, March, and part of
April are unfortunately missing<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</p>

with Agape; Anastasia was of Roman origin, though
she suffered death in Illyria: her name appears in the
canon of the Roman mass. The persons intended by the
other names are more uncertain); Dec. 27, natale of
St John, Evangelist; Dec. 28, natale of the Innocents.</p>

</div>

<p>It has been thought well to give in full this list,
defective though it is (as lacking the opening months
of the year). It exhibits indeed a large preponderance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of celebrations of local interest; but there are clear
indications that already the martyrs of other places
than Rome are securing themselves positions in the
Roman Kalendar.</p>

<p>The collection of masses and other liturgical
offices known as the Gelasian Sacramentary are not
without interest in illustrating the development of
the Kalendar, more particularly among the Franks.
But we pass on to consider the features of the
distinctively Roman service book, which, by a somewhat
misleading name, has been called the <i>Gregorian
Sacramentary</i>. In its present form (though it
contains many ancient elements) it is probably not
earlier than the close of the eighth century. Omitting
notices of moveable days, and exhibiting the dates by
the days of the month in our modern fashion, the
Kalendar runs as follows<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, some remarks being added

</div>

<p>When we examine these lists we find (1) the
principal festivals of the Lord, of His Mother, and of
His Apostles placed as they are still noted in the
Kalendar. It may be observed that Jan. 1 is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
styled the Circumcision; and there is no reference to
the Circumcision in the collect. In the mass for the
Epiphany the leading of the Gentiles by a star and
the gifts of the Magi are the prominent features. The
use of the name Ypapante as the first name for the
Purification (Feb. 2) suggests the Eastern origin of the
festival. We find (2) the great majority of the saints
recorded to be Roman martyrs—or of martyrs connected
with Rome, either in fact or by legend; but
(3) there are a few famous martyrs from other regions
of the world, as St George, St Vincent, SS. Cosmas
and Damian, and St Lucy, of Dec. 13. And Martin
of Tours has a place. We also find that some of the
obscurer saints of the earlier list disappear. Frequent
pilgrimages to the East, together with the interchange
of literary correspondence between the churches, are
sufficient to account for the appearance of the Oriental
martyrs. The leading features of the Western
Kalendar, as it prevailed in the mediaeval period, and
has subsisted to the present day, are already apparent.</p>

<p>It will be seen that All Saints does not appear on
Nov. 1; and yet it was certainly observed in many
churches in England, France, and Germany during
the eighth century. It is placed at Nov. 1 in the
<i>Metrical Martyrology</i> attributed to Bede, who died
in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 735. Though therefore this Martyrology, as
we now possess it, shows signs of having been re-handled,
it seems hazardous to attribute the origin of
the festival, as is done by some, to the dedication of
a church at Rome ‘in honorem Omnium Sanctorum’
by Pope Gregory III (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 731-741).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Much obscurity attends the origin of All Souls’
Day. It would seem that Amalarius of Metz, early
in the ninth century, had inserted in his Kalendar
an anniversary commemoration of all the departed,
and this was probably (as the context suggests) immediately
after All Saints’ Day; but the practice of
observing the day did not at once become general,
and the earliest clear testimony to Nov. 2 does not
emerge till the end of the tenth century, when Odilo,
abbot of Clugny, stimulated by a vision of the
sufferings of souls in purgatory, reported to him by
a pilgrim returning from Jerusalem, enjoined on the
monastic churches subject to Clugny the observance
of Nov. 2. The practice rapidly spread.</p>

<p>The dominant influence of the Roman Church in
Europe carried eventually the main features of the
Roman Kalendar into all regions of the West. In
early times at Rome the anniversary of a martyr was
ordinarily kept, not in the various churches of the
city and suburbs, but at the particular cemetery or
catacomb where he was buried, or at the tomb within
some church which had been erected over the place
where his remains rested. Outside the walls, and at
various distances along the great roads that led from
the city, most of these commemorations were celebrated.
As M. Batiffol has put it, with substantial
correctness, ‘the old Roman <i>Sanctorale</i> is the
<i>Sanctorale</i> of the cemeteries<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.’ It is a striking and
impressive illustration of the looking of the Western
peoples to Rome for guidance in matters of religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
that even obscure saints buried in the cemeteries of
the neighbourhood of the Apostolic See now have
places in the religious commemorations of all the
remotest Churches of the Roman obedience.</p>

<p>The study of the origins of the Kalendar of the
city of Rome illustrates the general proposition that
the martyrdoms of a particular city or district form
the main feature of each local Kalendar. To enter
into detail in respect to the early Kalendars of the
other provinces and dioceses of Europe, even when
the scanty evidence surviving makes the enquiry
possible, is too large a task to be attempted here.</p>

<p>The account of the commemorations of the early
martyrs may be brought to a close by calling attention
to a festival of general and perhaps universal
observance before the fifth century—the festival of
the pre-Christian martyrs, the seven Maccabees, on
Aug. 1. It was not unnatural in the age of persecution,
or when the memories of the great persecutions
were still fresh, to fasten upon the Old Testament
story of heroic constancy. After the Feast of St
Peter’s Chains in the West, and the Procession of the
Holy Cross in the East had displaced it from a
position of primary importance, it was not wholly
forgotten; and even now in both East and West in
a subsidiary manner the memory of the Maccabees is
still preserved in the services of the Church on Aug. 1.
Chrysostom speaks of the celebration being attended
in his day by a great concourse of the faithful, and
we possess three homilies of his for the festival.
Augustine shows us that the festival was observed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Africa in his time, and mentions that there was a
church called after the Maccabees at Antioch, a city
named, he makes a point to inform us, after their
persecutor, Antiochus Epiphanes. There are still
extant sermons for the festival preached by Gregory
Nazianzen, and, at a later date, by Pope Leo the
Great.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE LORD’S NATIVITY: THE EPIPHANY: THE
FESTIVALS WHICH IN EARLY TIMES FOLLOWED
IMMEDIATELY ON THE NATIVITY</span></h2>

<p>It is certain that the assigning of the birth of the
Lord to Dec. 25 appears first in the West; and it is
not till the last quarter of the fourth century that we
find it becoming established in some parts of the
East. St Chrysostom in a homily delivered in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 386
distinctly relates that it was about ten years earlier
the festival of Dec. 25 came to be observed at
Antioch, and that the festival had been observed in
the West from early times (ἄνωθεν)<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. At Constantinople
the festival was kept on Dec. 25, apparently
for the first time, in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 379 or 380; and about the
same time it appears in Cappadocia, as we learn from
the funeral oration on Basil the Great pronounced by
his brother, Gregory of Nyssa. At Alexandria this
date was adopted before <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 432. At Jerusalem,
however, the Nativity was observed on Jan. 6 not only
in the time of the <i>Pilgrimage</i> of ‘Silvia,’ but, if we
may credit the Egyptian monk Cosmas Indicopleustes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
even as late as at the middle of the sixth century.
This writer relates that the people of Jerusalem,
arguing from Luke iii. 23 (where, as he interprets
the passage, Jesus is said to be <i>beginning</i> to be
thirty years of age at His baptism) celebrated the
Nativity together with the Baptism on Jan. 6<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>

<p>But when did the observance of Dec. 25 make its
appearance in the West? It must have been a well-marked
festival at Rome when it appeared in the
Bucherian Kalendar in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 336 (see p. 15). And
about one hundred years earlier (as we learn from his
commentaries on Daniel) Hippolytus was led to infer,
partly from a belief (however it originated) that the
Incarnation took place at the Passover, and partly
by a process of calculation with the help of his cycle,
that the actual Incarnation took place on March 25
in the year of the world 5500 (or <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> 3), and
consequently the Nativity on Dec. 25<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Salisbury (J. Wordsworth) offers
an ingenious conjecture which may possibly point to
the early Eastern practice of commemorating the
Nativity on Jan. 6 having originated in a similar way.
Sozomen, the historian, writing in the fifth century,
states that the Montanists always celebrated the
pascha on the eighth day before the Ides of April
(<i>i.e.</i> April 6), if it fell on a Sunday, otherwise on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
following Sunday (<i>H.E.</i> vii. 18). The Bishop thinks
that the belief that April 6 was the proper day of the
pascha ‘may probably have been an opinion quite
unconnected with their [the Montanists’] sect.’ But
he rightly admits that ‘actual facts are not yet
forthcoming<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.’</p>

<p>Conjectures of this kind, though at present unsupported,
are well worth remembering, if for no other
reason, because students of early Christian literature
are thus put on the alert to note any testimonies
which make for, or else go to invalidate, the suggestion
offered. I may add that the Montanist notion, as
recorded by Sozomen, that the creation of the sun
in the heavens took place on April 6, is of a kind
that would well fall in, among fanciful speculators,
with the notion that the Incarnation also took place
on the same day<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>Why this time of the year, late in December or
early in January, was assigned for the Nativity is a
question which it is not possible to answer with
confidence. It is conceivable that the insecure and
blundering argument alleged, among others, by Chrysostom
may have had weight. He supposes that
Zacharias, the father of the Baptist, was the High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Priest, and that he had entered the Holy of Holies
on the day of Atonement when the angel appeared to
him. The day of Atonement was in September.
Six months later (Luke i. 26) the Annunciation was
made to St Mary; and after nine months the Saviour
was born.</p>

<p>By others it has been suggested that the festival
of Christmas on Dec. 25 did not originate in any
such calculations; but was suggested by the pagan
festival <i>Natalis Solis Invicti</i> marked at that day.
The solstice was passed. The sun was entering on
its new increases. ‘The Light of the world,’ ‘the
Sun of righteousness’ was to take the place of the
sun-god in the heavens<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.</p>

<p>The Theophany, or Epiphany (Jan. 6), is, like its
name, as characteristically Eastern in its origin as
the feast of the Nativity (Dec. 25) is Western; but
when it passed into the West it was in thought,
either at the outset or certainly soon, separated from
the Nativity; and eventually, while the baptism of
Christ was not ignored, the main stress of liturgical
allusion was on the visit of the Magi, so that the
festival is not uncommonly designated simply as the
feast of the Three Kings. In the East the dominant
thought is the manifestation of Christ’s divinity at
his baptism: and in the Basilian Menology the day
is simply named ‘The Baptism of our Lord Jesus
Christ.’ And it is to this connexion, baptism among
the Greeks being known as ‘illumination,’ that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
been attributed another name for the day, ‘the lights’
(τὰ φῶτα)<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the feast of the Epiphany
made its way to the West, through the churches of
Southern Gaul, whose affinities with the East are
recognised facts of history. At all events it is in
connexion with Gaul that we find the first reference
to the Epiphany in the West. The pagan historian
Ammianus Marcellinus, in his account of the Emperor
Julian in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 361 visiting a Christian church at
Vienne, says that it happened on the day in the
month of January which Christians call ‘Epiphania’
(<i>Hist.</i> xxi. 2).</p>

<p>The Epiphany was observed in the African Church
by the orthodox in the time of Augustine, but he
tells us that the Donatists did not observe it, ‘because
they love not unity, nor do they communicate with
the Eastern Church.’ The latter expression falls in
with the supposition that the West derived the
festival from the East. In the ancient Kalendar called
the Kalendar of Carthage (unfortunately of uncertain
date) we find at Jan. 6 the entry ‘Sanctum Epefania’
(<i>sic</i>). In Spain, as we learn from the canons of the
Council of Saragossa (can. 4), the festival was recognised
as a considerable commemoration before <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 380.
For Rome, we have to note the silence of the Bucherian
Kalendar; but for the fifth century we have the
testimony of Pope Leo, and we possess no fewer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
eight sermons of his upon the festival of the Epiphany;
in these the manifestation of Christ to the Magi is
the truth upon which he chiefly enlarges. Elsewhere
in the West we have references to other manifestations
of the Deity of Christ, as at His baptism, and His
first miracle at Cana. But generally, as in the East
the baptism, so in the West the manifestation to
the Gentiles is the leading note of preachers or
theologians<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>.</p>

<p>Among the Armenians the Epiphany is reckoned
one of the five chief festivals: it is preceded by a
week’s fast, and is followed by an octave. It is by
them still reckoned as the day of the Nativity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The festivals of the days immediately following
Christmas.</i></h3>

<p>We see that in the Gregorian Kalendar the commemorations
of St Stephen (Dec. 26), St John the
Evangelist (Dec. 27), and Holy Innocents (Dec. 28),
in the order with which we are familiar, were already
established in the West. And long before the period
of the Gregorian Kalendar we have evidence that in
some parts of the East before the close of the fourth
century a group of festivals commemorating eminent
saints of the New Testament were celebrated between
the feast of the Nativity and the first of January.
Basil the Great died on Jan. 1 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 379; and his
brother Gregory of Nyssa delivered the funeral oration
at his burial. In this discourse the preacher speaks
of a group of feasts preceding the first of January,
namely of St Stephen, St Peter, St James and St John,
and St Paul. It may with some reason be believed
that the dates of these festivals had no relation, real
or fancied, to the days of the deaths of these saints
of the Church’s beginnings.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>As regards St James we know that he was killed at the
time of the Passover, so that the Hieronymian Martyrology
makes the day in December to be the day of his
consecration to the episcopate. Liturgists have said it
was becoming that the King of glory should come into the
world accompanied by the chiefs of his court. And it is
not a wholly baseless fancy that already there was a desire
(of which at a later period we have many illustrations)
to connect a great festival with one or more other commemorations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
associated with it in thought. The memories
of the age of the martyrs would naturally suggest the name
of the protomartyr; while the relations of the Lord to
St James, St John, and St Peter, and the eminence of
St Paul may perhaps sufficiently account for their appearance
here.</p>

</div>

<p>There is little doubt that at the close of the fourth
century the churches of Asia Minor had festivals of
St Stephen on Dec. 26, St James and St John on
Dec. 27, and St Peter and St Paul on Dec. 28<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>. And
in the West our earliest information shows us St
Stephen on Dec. 26; but there are variations as
regards the other festivals. The ancient Kalendar
of Carthage shows us on Dec. 27 ‘St John <i>the Baptist</i>
and James the Apostle, whom Herod slew,’ and Holy
Innocents on Dec. 28<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</p>

<p>The earliest Roman service-books show us only
St John on Dec. 27, and he is St John <i>the Evangelist</i><a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.
Yet in the so-called Martyrology of St
Jerome (which, though interpolated, contains many
ancient features), we find at this day, together
with ‘the Assumption of St John at Ephesus,’ ‘the
ordination to the episcopate of James, the Lord’s
brother, who was crowned with martyrdom at the
paschal time<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.’ The Holy Innocents (Dec. 28) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
known in the Latin books since the sixth century,
and may well have been earlier; but Peter and Paul
are found together on another day (June 29), the day
of their martyrdom at Rome, as was generally assumed.
Though we are not able to determine with
precision on what day the Innocents of Bethlehem
were commemorated in early times, there can be little
doubt that there was some commemoration of those
whom, as St Augustine says, ‘the Church has received
to the honour of the martyrs.’</p>

<p>There are some reasons for conjecturing that the
commemoration of the Innocents was at first in
association with the Epiphany. In the second half
of the fourth century the poet Prudentius has some
pretty lines on the Holy Innocents as martyrs in his
hymn on the Epiphany<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. And Leo the Great in
more than one of his sermons on the Epiphany has
laudatory passages on the martyrdom of the Innocents.
Yet in estimating the weight that should attach to
such references it should be remembered that Herod’s
slaughter of the children at Bethlehem is in the
Gospel narrative so closely connected with the visit
of the Magi that it would not be unnatural for both
poet and preacher to touch on that striking story,
although there were no intentional commemoration
of the Innocents attached by the Church to that day.
In the Byzantine Kalendar the Fourteen Thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Holy Infants are commemorated on Dec. 29. In the
Armenian Kalendar the Fourteen Thousand Innocent
Martyrs are commemorated on June 10. It deserves
notice that in the Mozarabic Kalendars we find
‘St James the Lord’s Brother’ at Dec. 28; ‘St John
Evangelist’ at Dec. 29; and ‘St James the Brother
of John’ at Dec. 30.</p>

<span class="smaller">OTHER COMMEMORATIONS OF EVENTS IN
THE LORD’S LIFE. PENTECOST</span></h2>

<p>The commemoration of the death and resurrection
of Jesus Christ was in the nature of things a natural
and inevitable outcome of the religious beliefs and
feelings of the infant Church. The fixing of days for
the commemoration of other events in the life of our
Lord came with thought and reflection; they belong
to the period of constructiveness, and we have no
evidence to show that their appearance was very early.
Tertullian is silent about other days than Sunday
(the Lord’s Day), the Pasch (including the Passion
and the Resurrection), and Pentecost<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>; and Origen
particularises the Lord’s Day, the Parasceve (perhaps
in the sense of the weekly Friday ‘station’), the
Pasch, and Pentecost, as being days specially observed
by Christians<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Circumcision</b> is obviously dependent on
whatever was regarded as the date of the Nativity,
and is the result of reflection and ecclesiastical constructiveness.
It is eight days after the Nativity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
on Jan. 1, with all Christendom, save the Armenians,
who celebrating the Nativity (together with other
Epiphanies of the Lord) on Jan. 6, naturally observe
Jan. 13 as the day of the Circumcision. The day is
not noted in the Bucherian Kalendar, nor in the
Carthaginian. Baillet<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> comes to the conclusion that
it appears first as appointed for general observance
as a festival, about the middle of the seventh century,
and in Spain, where servile work was forbidden on
this day. But it would appear from the Canons of
the Fourth Council of Toledo that the day was then
observed with penitential features (canon 11). From
the Sermons of Augustine we learn that in his time
Jan. 1 was observed by Christians as a solemn fast, in
protest against the licentious revelry and excesses of
the pagans at this time of the year<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. And as late as the
Second Council of Tours (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 567) it is enjoined that,
while all other days between the Nativity and the
Epiphany are to be treated (in regard to use of food)
as festivals, an exception is to be made for the space
of three days at the beginning of January, for which
time the fathers had appointed litanies to be made
‘ad calcandam Gentilium consuetudinem.’ But it
should be remarked that the canon (17) dealing with
the subject has special reference to fasts to be observed
by monks. It is therefore not impossible that
the fast had by this time ceased to be observed by
the general body of the faithful, but, in a spirit of
conservatism, was regarded as proper to be maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in the monasteries. The canon is interesting for
another reason; it affords perhaps the earliest example
of the use of the term ‘Circumcision’ as applied to
this day, which appears in the Gelasian and Gregorian
Sacramentaries simply as <i>Octava Domini</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the
octave of the Nativity. In the Gelasian Sacramentary
there is no emphasis in the service on the Circumcision,
while the prayer called <i>Ad populum</i> distinctly
points to a prohibition against partaking of the
<i>convivium diabolicum</i> of the pagans. And a mass
immediately following that for the Octave, entitled
<i>Ad prohibendum ab idolis</i>, points in the same direction.
The Gregorian Sacramentary shows no reference to
the Circumcision in the prayers of the mass<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>Even in the early part of the seventh century
Isidore of Seville condemns the indecent gaieties indulged
in on this day, and recalls the ancient injunction
that the day should be observed as a fast<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. The
fourth Council of Toledo (canon 11) represents as
the practice of Spain and Gaul the omission of the
singing of <i>Alleluia</i> on the Kalends of January, <i>propter
errorem gentilium</i>.</p>

<p>In the later Western service-books the thought
of the Circumcision is given greater prominence, and
intermingles with the thoughts suggested by the
Octave. The feast of the Circumcision appears in
the Greek Church in the eighth century<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Commemoration of Passiontide; Holy
Week</b> (the ‘Great Week,’ as it is styled in the East).
The commemoration of the death of the Saviour is
the primitive and essential element: other days
were given places as the result of reflection, and of
the desire to reproduce liturgically in a mimetic
way the events of the Lord’s history during the last
paschal week. We possess the early testimony of
Tertullian for the <i>dies Paschae</i>, for so he names the
day. He tells us that it was a public and general
fast, and that the kiss of peace was omitted from the
services of the Church<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. But for Palm Sunday,
<i>Coena Domini</i>, and the Great Sabbath we have no
evidence till much later. It is from Palestine that
we get the earliest notice of the rites of Palm
Sunday. In her account of the ceremonies at Jerusalem
‘Silvia’ describes the procession of palm-bearers
on the Sunday of the Great Week. The feast of
Palms is also mentioned in the life of Euthymius,
abbot in Palestine, who died at a very advanced age
in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 473. But in the West the carrying of palms
does not appear earlier than the ninth century. The
commemoration (<i>Natalis Calicis</i>) of the institution
of the Eucharist on the night before the Lord suffered
probably had its rise about the same time as Palm
Sunday; and a certain mimetic character was given
to the rites of the Thursday by delaying the celebration
of the Liturgy till the evening. This was further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
enhanced in the Church of Carthage (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 397), which
in view of the original institution of the Eucharist
having been after supper, made an express synodical
declaration that the rule of fasting communion was
binding ‘excepto uno die anniversario, quo coena
domini celebratur<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.’ And St Augustine expressly
affirms that the practice of the Church did not
condemn communion after the evening meal on the
Thursday in Holy Week<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>. The name <i>Dies Mandati</i>
(which has probably given us our <i>Maundy Thursday</i>)
is not very ancient. In mediaeval times the particular
mandate of the Lord was taken to be the
feet-washing, before or during which were sung the
words ‘Mandatum novum do vobis<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.’</p>

<p>At Rome, as late as the time of St Leo, in regard
to the days specially observed in Holy Week, the
only distinction from ordinary weeks seems to have
been the commemoration of the institution of the
Eucharist on Thursday. The adoration of the Cross<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
on Good Friday (which we find at Jerusalem in the
days of ‘Silvia’) and the mass of the pre-sanctified
were later additions, and are regarded by Duchesne as
having been introduced into the West in the seventh
or eighth century<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. The observances of the Saturday
were those of the vigil of Easter.</p>

<p><b>The Ascension</b>: in the Greek Kalendar, and
frequently in Greek writers, with a different connotation,
‘the Taking up,’ ‘Assumption’ (ἀνάληψις)<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>,
was celebrated forty days after Easter, as the actual
Ascension took place forty days after the Resurrection;
it is obviously a festival of the constructive period.
There is no mention of it in the earliest Christian
writings; but, without here going into details of
evidence, it may be stated that the festival was
observed, possibly early in, and certainly before, the
close of the fourth century. It is noticed by ‘Silvia’
(though the name Ascensa is not given to it) as a
day on which at Bethlehem, where the vigil was kept,
the bishop of Jerusalem and the presbyters preached,
but it does not appear that the Eucharist was celebrated.
There was a procession back to Jerusalem
in the evening. Augustine classes the day with
the Passion, the Resurrection, and the advent of the
Holy Spirit (Pentecost), as observed ‘anniversaria
solemnitate<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.’ In the Sacramentary of Leo many
masses <i>in Ascensa</i> (= <i>Ascensione</i>) <i>Domini</i> are to be
found. Both in the East and in some parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
West it was customary to celebrate the festival outside
the cities,—a practice suggested doubtless by
Luke xxiv. 50.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that many old English
writers, both before and after the Reformation, use
the term ‘Holy Thursday’ for this day.</p>

<p><b>The Transfiguration</b> (Aug. 6 in the Byzantine<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>,
Ethiopic, and later mediaeval and modern
Roman Kalendars: on the 7th Sunday after Pentecost
in the Armenian) is of late appearance. If a certain
canon (or prose hymn) on the Transfiguration attributed
to John of Damascus be really his, it would
point to the probable observance of the day in the
eighth century in the East. In the West the festival
appears much later; but the evidence indicates its
having had a partial and local observance long before
it was enjoined by Pope Calixtus III for the Church
generally in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1457. This Pope appointed an
office for the day, which was afterwards somewhat
altered by Pius V. The action of Calixtus was
prompted by thankfulness for a victory over the
Turks at Belgrade. Among the Greeks the Transfiguration
is a day of great solemnity. It is preceded
by a ‘proheortia’ and affects the following eight days.
The Armenians observe a preparatory fast for a week<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p><b>Pentecost.</b> This word as commonly employed
by early Christian writers signifies the whole period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of fifty days after the Resurrection. It is thus that
the term is used by Tertullian in a passage (<i>de
Idolat.</i> 14) where he compares the number of festival
days among the pagans with the number of Christian
festivals. The same is probably true where he speaks
of Pentecost as ‘ordinandis lavacris latissimum
spatium’ (<i>de Baptismo</i> 19). During that period
fasting, and kneeling at prayer, at least in the public
assemblies, were forbidden: and <i>Alleluia</i>, which had
been silent, was resumed. It seems, however, that
once at least Tertullian had in view, in the use of the
word, the day on which the period closed<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>. Origen
in a similar way uses the word for the whole period,
but also seems to distinguish between the general
and more restricted signification of the word<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>. Earlier
than either of these is the testimony of Irenaeus (if
we may accept it as his) cited, as from his lost book
<i>On the Pascha</i>, by Pseudo-Justin (<i>Quaest. et Respons.
ad Orthodoxos</i>, 115), where Irenaeus speaks of not
kneeling in Pentecost, as that time is of equal dignity
with the Lord’s day, ‘Pentecost’ being here used
evidently for a season. On the other hand, the
compiler, whoever he was, of the <i>Quaestiones</i>, in
which Irenaeus is quoted, in the same place speaks of
not kneeling ‘from the Pascha to Pentecost,’ using
the latter term in its restricted sense. In the newly-recovered
<i>Testament of the Lord</i><a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Pentecost is used
for the fifty days between Easter and our Whitsunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
(i. 28, 42; ii. 12). An interesting survival
of the old signification of Pentecost is still to be found
in the Greek service-books, where the term <i>Mesopentecoste</i>
is used for special festal observances mid-way
between Easter and Whitsunday, commencing on
the Wednesday following the third Sunday after
Easter, and lasting for a week.</p>

<p>In the forty-third canon of the Council of Elvira
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 305) we have a clear example of the use of the
word Pentecost for the fiftieth day. And after that
date the word is widely used in that sense: while
the festival itself assumes gradually more and more
dignity and importance. ‘Silvia’ describes the elaborate
ceremonial observed on this day at Jerusalem
towards the close of the fourth century.</p>

<p>There are considerable difficulties attendant on
an attempt to assign a precise date to the addition of
an octave to this festival; and the festal character of
the octave week was affected by the ember days
occurring in that week. In the Gelasian Sacramentary,
as it has come down to us, we have the ‘propers’
for a mass on the Sunday of the octave of Pentecost.
The mass may be described as a mass of the Holy
Spirit, praying for protection for the Church from
the allurements of the vain and deceitful philosophy
of the world; true knowledge of the nature of God
was given by the bestowal of the Holy Spirit, the
Spirit of wisdom, and knowledge, and understanding,
and counsel. The benedictions, which immediately
follow, on those who return to the Catholic unity from
the Arian and other heresies, suggest that it was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
this way that the octave of Pentecost came at a later
date to be made a festival in honour of the mystery
of the blessed Trinity<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. The public reception to the
Catholic unity of Arian and other heretics would
gradually cease to be a feature of the season: but the
liturgical colouring of the service would remain, and
would have to be accounted for. As a matter of fact,
however, the establishment of a festival of the Trinity
with a special office and mass was of late date. It
makes its appearance in the Low Countries in the
tenth century, and made its way but slowly, and
with varying success. Pope Alexander II, who died
in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1073, when consulted on the subject, wrote
that according to the Roman rite there was no day
set apart to commemorate the Trinity any more than
the Unity of the Divine Being, and that every day of
the year was truly consecrated to the honour of the
Trinity in Unity. It was not till the fourteenth
century, under the pontificate of John XXII, that the
Roman Church received the feast of the Trinity and
attached it to the first Sunday after Pentecost<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.</p>

<p>In England, according to Gervase of Canterbury,
Archbishop Thomas Becket instituted the principal
feast of the Trinity on the octave of Pentecost<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<span class="smaller">FESTIVALS OF ST MARY THE VIRGIN</span></h2>

<h3>I. <i>Western Kalendars.</i></h3>

<p>The history of the origin of some of the following
festivals is obscure; and it is impossible to be precise
as to the dates of their first appearance. We speak
with some reservation of the Festival of Feb. 2,
known first in the West, as well as in the East, by
the name Hypapante (<i>i.e.</i> ‘the Meeting’ of Simeon
with the Lord and His Mother), and afterwards as
the Purification of the Virgin. It seems at first in
the West to have been a festival of our Lord rather
than of the Virgin. In the <i>propria</i> for ‘Yppapanti’
(<i>sic</i>) in the Gregorian Sacramentary the allusion to
St Mary is of the slightest. Hence at the time when
it first appeared in the West it may be reckoned as
having no special reference to St Mary. The Church
of Rome does not appear (according to Duchesne) to
have observed any festival of the Virgin before the
seventh century, when it adopted the four following
festivals from the Church of Byzantium.</p>

<p>1. <b>The Purification</b> (or, in early times,
Hypapante). Its date (Feb. 2) is determined by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
counting forty days from Christmas (Luke ii. 22:
compare Levit. xii. 2, 4).</p>

<p>A feast of much dignity and importance (<i>cum
summa laetitia, ac si per Pascha</i>) commemorating
the Presentation of the Lord in the Temple is noticed
as celebrated (towards the close of the fourth century)
at Jerusalem at the time of the pilgrimage of ‘Silvia.’
It was observed on Feb. 14 (the 40th day after the
Epiphany, reckoned as the day of the Lord’s Nativity):
but ‘Silvia’ does not appear to have regarded it as in
any sense having special reference to St Mary. The
words of the pilgrim simply record the incident in
the Temple; and it looks as if the feast were only
commemorative of a remarkable event in the history
of the Lord.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out that the Feast of the
Presentation of the Lord in the Temple is still
observed by the Armenians on Feb. 14, as they still
celebrate the Nativity on Jan. 6.</p>

<p>The origin of the consecrating of candles and
carrying them in procession which has given us the
low Latin names <i>candelaria</i> and <i>candelcisa</i>, the
French <i>chandeleur</i>, the Italian <i>candelora</i>, the German
<i>Lichtmesse</i>, and our English name <i>Candlemas</i>, and
which from early times formed a striking feature in the
ritual of the Feast, has been conjecturally connected
by some with a symbolical setting forth of the words
of Simeon (Luke ii. 32); and by others with the
ceremonial of the heathen <i>Lupercalia</i>. But the
matter is still involved in doubt.</p>

<p>In the East the establishment of the festival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
throughout the Empire is generally assigned to
Justinian in the year 542. The appearance of
Hypapante in the so-called Gregorian Sacramentary
is, it need scarcely be said, no proof that the festival
was observed in the time of Gregory the Great.</p>

<p>The word ‘Hypapante’ lingered long in the West.
We find it as the only name of the festival in
the Martyrology of Bede; and one hundred and fifty
years later the day is marked in Usuard as simply
‘Hypapante Domini.’</p>

<p>2. <b>The Annunciation</b> (March 25) like ‘Hypapante’
was probably originally a feast of our Lord,
as marking the time of the Incarnation. Inferentially
it may be considered as well established both in the
East and West considerably before the close of the
seventh century. Duchesne considers that we have
very clear testimony to this feast before the Council
in Trullo (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 692), where it was spoken of as already
established. Perhaps earlier, or, at latest, almost
contemporary, in the West is the testimony of what
is known as the tenth Council of Toledo (?<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 694)<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
where the complaint is made that in various parts of
Spain the festival of St Mary was observed on various
days, and it is further added that as the festival
cannot be fitly celebrated either in Lent, or when
overshadowed by the Paschal festival, the Council
ordains that for the future the day should be xv Kal.
Jan. (Dec. 18) and the Nativity of the Lord on
viii Kal. Jan. (Dec. 25). It is plain that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of the nature of an octave was to follow the festival
of Dec. 18; and there is added in a somewhat apologetic
tone, ‘nam quid festum matris nisi incarnatio
verbi?’ (canon 1). The Trullan Council took a different
course. While continuing to prohibit all other
festivals during Lent, it sanctioned the celebration of
this. In the Milanese rite the feast was celebrated
on the fourth Sunday in Advent. In the Mozarabic
Missal we find in the Kalendar the Annunciation of
St Mary marked both on March 25 and Dec. 18; the
latter being distinguished as the ‘Annunciation of
the O,’ referring to the great Antiphons sung at that
season.</p>

<p>The older titles of the festival were the ‘Annunciation
of the Lord,’ ‘the Annunciation of the
Angel to the Blessed Virgin Mary,’ or ‘the Conception
of Christ.’</p>

<p>The rules in the Roman rite for transferring the
Annunciation to another day under certain circumstances
will be found in technical works of the
commentators.</p>

<p>3. <b>The Nativity of the Virgin</b> (Sept. 8).
This also is found in the West towards the close of
the seventh century. Durandus, who is often more
fanciful than wise, had in this case perhaps some
historical foundation for his assertion that the festival
was founded by Pope Sergius I in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 695. The
story of Joachim and Anna, the parents of St Mary,
is found in certain apocryphal Gospels which circulated
among the Gnostics<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>4. <b>The Sleep, or (later) Assumption, of
the Virgin</b> (Aug. 15) appears in the West about
the same time as the <i>Annunciation</i> and the <i>Nativity
of the Virgin</i>. All three were unknown to Gregory
the Great. It originated in the East, and was there
known as the Sleep and (afterwards) the Translation.
According to the historian, Nicephorus Callistus, the
festival was founded by the Emperor Maurice (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
582-602). It is beyond our province here to deal
with the legend of St Mary’s body as well as soul
being taken up to heaven. The festival made its
way slowly in Gaul, but was eventually adopted by
Charlemagne. As late as the twelfth century it was
not universally observed in the East.</p>

<p>The advance in the titles of the festival from
<i>depositio</i>, <i>pausatio</i>, <i>dormitio</i> to <i>transitus</i> and <i>assumptio</i>
is not without significance. In Bede the name is
<i>Dormitio</i>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that all these four festivals
came to Rome from Byzantium. In the later mediaeval
period they were of universal obligation in the West<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.</p>

<p>For notices of the observance of the death of St
Mary on Jan. 18, see Baillet, <i>op. cit.</i>, <span class="smcapuc">VI.</span> 11.</p>

<p>5. <b>The Presentation of St Mary</b> (<i>praesentatio</i>,
<i>illatio</i>, <i>oblatio</i>) in the Temple at Jerusalem.
In the modern Roman Kalendar at Nov. 21, it is a
‘greater double.’ It does not appear in the Kalendar
of the Sarum Breviary or Missal; but the <i>Sarum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Enchiridion</i> (1530) gives Nov. 21, and the Office is
printed in the Breviary. There were many exceptions
to this feast being observed<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>. The festival is based
on a legend<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> that at an early age Mary was dedicated
to the service of God in the Temple, and that
there she grew up, and served under the priests and
Levites. The first appearance of the festival is at
Constantinople; and there is evidence for it there in
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1150. It passed to the West towards the close
of the fourteenth century<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>. And with more certainty
than is usually possible in such enquiries we can
trace its introduction to the impression made by the
accounts, brought back from Cyprus, by Philip de
Mazières, of the solemnities of the feast in the East.
Pius V (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1566-1572) withdrew it from the
Roman Kalendar; but it was restored by Sixtus V
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1585-1590).</p>

<p>6. <b>The Conception of St Mary</b> (Dec. 8).
Since Dec. 8, 1854, when Pius IX (in the Apostolic
Letters <i>Ineffabilis Deus</i>) decreed the doctrine of
the <i>Immaculate Conception</i> to be a necessary article
of the Faith, the epithet <i>Immaculate</i> has been prefixed
to the original title in the service-books of the
Roman Communion. In the Greek Church the day
observed is Dec. 9, and the title is the <i>Conception of
St Anna, grandmother of God</i>, the Easterns connecting
the word ‘conception’ with the person who conceived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
while the Latins connected it with the person who
was conceived. The festival was commanded to be
observed throughout the Empire of the East by the
Emperor Manuel Comnenus in the middle of the
twelfth century.</p>

<p>The evidence seems to point to the fact that, like
several other festivals of the Virgin, this originated
in the East. In the Greek <i>Horologion</i> we find it
related that, according to the ancient tradition of the
Church, Anna was barren and well stricken in years,
and also that her spouse Joachim was an aged man.
In sorrow for their childlessness they prayed to the
Lord, who hearing their prayers intimated to them
by an angel that they would have a child, and in
accordance with the promise Anna conceived<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>. It
appears that the festival had no dogmatic significance;
and it had its parallel in the historical festival, still
observed in the Greek Church on Sept. 23, of the
Conception of St John the Baptist, a festival which
also had a place in the old Latin Martyrologies.</p>

<p>In the West the local observance of the day is
associated commonly with the name of St Anselm,
archbishop of Canterbury, who, in one form of the
story, on a voyage from England to Normandy
during a storm vowed to establish the festival. But
the day is marked in some English Kalendars just
before the Norman Conquest, though at first it had
a very limited acceptance<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. It is plain that at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
early date there were some who connected the festival
with the belief that St Mary differed from other
mortals in being without original sin. For when the
Chapter of the Cathedral of Lyons were about to
institute the festival in that church, St Bernard of
Clairvaux wrote (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1140) expostulating with them
partly on the ground that though St Mary was, as
he believed, sanctified in the womb, yet her conception
was not holy. He added that this was a
novel festival, ‘quam ritus Ecclesiae nescit, non
probat ratio, non commendat antiqua traditio’; and
declares that it was the outcome of the simplicity
of a few unlearned persons, the daughter of inconsiderateness
(<i>levitatis</i>), and the sister of superstition
(<i>Epist.</i> 174).</p>

<p>John Beleth, Dean of the Faculty of Theology at
Paris, towards the close of the twelfth century argued
much in the same way as St Bernard. And in the
following century, and towards its close, such a leading
authority as Durandus, bishop of Mende, in his
<i>Rationale</i> says that there were some who would
celebrate this festival, but that he could not approve
of it, because St Mary was conceived in original sin,
though she was sanctified in the womb.</p>

<p>As regards the Church of Rome (properly so
called), Innocent III in the beginning of the thirteenth
century declares in one of his sermons (<i>Serm.</i> <span class="smcapuc">II</span> <i>de
Joan. Bapt.</i>) that no other conception than that of
the Lord Jesus was celebrated in the Church. Nevertheless
the celebration of the day spread both in
France, and, more particularly, in England. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Council of Oxford (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1222) approved of the feast,
but distinguished it from the other feasts of the
Virgin by leaving it to be observed or not at discretion.
In the province of Canterbury the day was made
of obligation by Archbishop Simon Mepeham (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
1328-33).</p>

<p>In 1263 the Franciscans resolved to celebrate the
festival publicly in their churches. But even the
Franciscans were not agreed among themselves as to
the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. Alvarus
Pelagius, the Spanish Theologian, Great Penitentiary
of Pope John XXII, in his <i>de Planctu Ecclesiae</i>
(1332) declares that ‘the new and fantastic opinion
should be cancelled by the faithful.’</p>

<p>As is well known, the Dominicans took a strong and
even violent part against the doctrine. The greatest
doctor of the thirteenth century, Thomas Aquinas,
had clearly pronounced that St Mary was not sanctified
till the infusion of her <i>anima rationalis</i>. But
with regard to the feast of the Conception he states
that inasmuch as the Roman Church, though not
celebrating the Conception of the Blessed Virgin,
tolerates the practice of certain Churches which do
celebrate it, the celebration of the feast is not to be
wholly reprobated; and he adds that we must not
infer from the observance of the day that St Mary
was holy in her conception, but because we are
ignorant as to the time when she was sanctified, the
feast of her sanctification rather than of her conception
is celebrated on the day of her conception<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Accordingly in Dominican Kalendars we find the day
marked as <i>Sanctificatio Mariae</i>.</p>

<p>The Council of Bâle (1439) adopted a constitution
applicable to the whole Church that the feast should
be observed according to the ancient and laudable
custom on Dec. 8, and that it should be known under
the title of the <i>Conception</i> of the Blessed Virgin
Mary, forbidding the use of the name <i>Sanctification</i>,
as having a less extended use. The Roman See, not
recognising this Council, did not take action till
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1477, when Sixtus IV, who had been a Franciscan,
published an ordinance (and it is the very first
decree of any Pope on the subject) granting large
indulgences to all the faithful who celebrated, or
assisted at, the Mass and Office of the Conception on
the festival or throughout its octave. In 1483 the
same Pope pronounced excommunication on any
preachers who asserted that St Mary was conceived
in original sin or that those who observed the festival
sinned<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>. Clement VIII (1592-1605) raised the
festival to the rank of a greater double. The later
history of the festival can be pursued in Baillet, and
in recent writers dealing with Pius IX.</p>

<p>For minor festivals of the Virgin, such as ‘St
Mary at Snows,’ the Visitation of St Mary, the
Espousals (<i>Desponsatio</i>), the Most Holy Name of
Mary, the Seven Sorrows, the Rosary of St Mary,
Blessed Mary of Mount Carmel, the Expectation of
the Delivery (<i>partûs</i>), and others, the reader may
consult Baillet, the <i>Catholic Dictionary</i>, etc.</p>

<h3>II. <i>The Orthodox Church of the East.</i></h3>

<p>A reference to the classification of Feasts in the
Eastern Church<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> will show that among the twelve
principal Feasts are found (1) The <i>Evangelismos
of the Theotokos</i>, March 25, corresponding to the
Western feast of the Annunciation; (2) the Repose
of the Theotokos, Aug. 15; (3) the Nativity of the
Theotokos, Sept. 8; and (4) the Entrance of the
Theotokos into the Temple, Nov. 21, corresponding
to the Presentation of the Virgin in the West.</p>

<p>To these have to be added the following feasts of
lesser dignity: (5) Hypapante (the Meeting of St
Mary with Simeon and Anna in the Temple), Feb. 2,
corresponding to the Western Purification. This is
a day of obligation: but (as has been already remarked)
it is perhaps to be regarded rather as a
festival of the Lord than of St Mary. (6) The
Deposition of the precious Vestment of the Theotokos
in the Church of Blachernae at Constantinople,
July 2: (7) the Deposition of the precious Zone of
the Theotokos at Constantinople, Aug. 31: (8) the
Conception of St Anna (<i>i.e.</i> her conception of St
Mary), Dec. 9, a day of obligation: (9) the Synaxis
of the Theotokos and Joseph, her spouse, Dec. 26,
a day of obligation. This day is also called the
Synaxis of the Theotokos fleeing into Egypt. The
Greeks consider that the visit of the Magi was exactly
one year after the birth of Christ, and that the flight
into Egypt was on the day following that visit.</p>

<span class="smaller">FESTIVALS OF THE APOSTLES, THE EVANGELISTS,
AND OF OTHER PERSONS NAMED
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. OCTAVES AND
VIGILS</span></h2>

<p>In the Greek Church there has continued to the
present day a Synaxis of the Twelve Apostles on
the day following St Peter and St Paul (June 29);
and in the West we find a commemoration of all the
Apostles, connected with the festival of St Peter and
St Paul, in the Leonine Sacramentary<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. There is a
<i>Natale Omnium Apostolorum</i> with a vigil in the
Gelasian Sacramentary. This festival may have preceded
all separate commemorations. It would seem
to have been observed close to the date of St Peter
and St Paul.</p>

<p>With certain notable exceptions, feasts of the
New Testament Saints came but slowly into the
cycle of Christian solemnities. With some exceptions,
more or less doubtful, there is no reason to think
that the days of the deaths of the Apostles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
known to those who gave them places in the Kalendars.
It is highly probable in some cases, and not
improbable in others, that the dates assigned for the
festivals really mark some deposition or translation
of the supposed relics of those commemorated, or
the dedication of some church named in their honour.
Considerations of the space at our disposal demand
that the subject should be only lightly touched;
but references are given to easily accessible works.
And we deal only with the more notable festivals,
or festivals of early appearance.</p>

<p><b>St Peter and St Paul</b> (June 29). There is
no question that at an early date this festival was
celebrated at Rome. The belief was entertained by
several ancient writers that these two Saints suffered
death upon the same day of the month, but in
different years.</p>

<p>We have seen already (p. 33 f.) that in the East
at an early date there was a commemoration of St
Peter in close connexion with the commemoration of
the Lord’s Nativity. But at Rome in the earliest
Western Kalendar (the Bucherian) we find two festivals
that deserve consideration: (1) <i>Natale Petri
de Cathedra</i> at Feb. 22; and (2) <i>Petri in Catacumbas
et Pauli Os[t]iense</i>, at June 29, to which are added
the words, <i>Tusco et Basso Coss</i>. To deal first with
the latter entry; as the consulate of Tuscus and
Bassus marks <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 258, it has been not unnaturally
conjectured that the record marks the date of some
translation of the Apostles’ relics. But that conjecture
does not absolutely exclude the supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that the day chosen for the translation was the day
which was believed to have been the day of their
martyrdom. The translation, as Bishop Pearson<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
long ago supposed, was the removal, perhaps with
a view to safety, of the remains to a place at the
third milestone on the Appian Way, called ‘Ad
Catacumbas,’ during the heat of the persecution
under Valerian.</p>

<p>The observance of a commemoration of St Paul
on June 30 (still so marked in the Roman Kalendar),
has been accounted for by the fact that the bishop of
Rome celebrating mass first at the tomb of St Peter,
and afterwards on the same day having to go a long
distance to the tomb of St Paul, there to celebrate
again, it was arranged to observe the festival of
St Paul on the day after June 29, with a view to
avoiding the fatigue and inconvenience of the two
functions on the one day.</p>

<p><b>Cathedra Petri.</b> The entry cited above from
the Bucherian Kalendar, <i>Natale Petri de cathedra</i>,
‘the Festival of Peter of the Chair,’ looks
very like the record of the dedication of a church,
where perhaps a seated statue of the Apostle was
placed<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>. We are at once reminded of the large
seated figure of Hippolytus discovered in 1551 on
the Via Tiburtina. Or, as De Rossi supposes, the
festival may have had to do with the actual wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
chair (as was supposed) which St Peter had used, and
of which we hear in the time of Gregory the Great.
But, whatever may have been the origin of the
festival, it came at a later time to be regarded as
marking the date of the beginning of St Peter’s
episcopate; and there is some evidence that the
festival was made much of as a Christian set off
against the popular pagan solemnity of <i>Cara cognatio</i>
on Feb. 22, when the dead members of each family
were commemorated.</p>

<p>Duchesne asserts, with something of undue confidence,
that this was without doubt the ground for
the selection of the date Feb. 22 for the Christian
festival; but without committing ourselves to the
acceptance of Duchesne’s view, we may say that it
may well have been a reason why efforts were made
to draw off the faithful, by means of the Christian
solemnity, from the temptation to join in rites incompatible
with their profession. The festival was
unknown in the East, and, what is more remarkable,
equally unknown in the Church of North Africa;
but it appeared early in Gaul, and, as has been conjectured,
with a view to prevent the festival falling,
as would occasionally happen, in Lent, the date was
pushed back to Jan. 18. At Rome it continued to
be observed on Feb. 22.</p>

<p>It would seem to have been due to the anxiety
of the early mediaeval Kalendar-makers and Martyrologists
to comprehend in their lists everything in
the way of church solemnities recorded in any
Kalendar that we have the invention of St Peter’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Chair at Antioch. They found some Kalendars
marking <i>Cathedra Petri</i> at Jan. 18, and others at
Feb. 22. Might not, they would argue, these double
dates be accounted for by the old accounts that
St Peter had exercised an episcopate at Antioch
before he came to Rome?</p>

<p>Venerable Bede does not mark any Festival of
St Peter’s Chair at Jan. 18, but at Feb. 22 writes
‘Apud Antiochiam Cathedra S. Petri.’ But in the
Martyrology, known as <i>Gellonense</i> (circ. 800), and in
Usuard’s Martyrology we find at Jan. 18, ‘Cathedrae
S. Petri Apostoli quâ Romae primo sedit,’ and at
Feb. 22 ‘Cathedrae S. Petri Apostoli quâ sedit apud
Antiochiam’ (<i>Gellonense</i>), ‘Apud Antiochiam Cathedrae
S. Petri’ (<i>Usuard</i>). There continued to be
a variety of use in different dioceses as to the day
on which ‘St Peter’s Chair’ was celebrated; and it
was not till as late as 1558 that Pope Paul IV settled
the question by ordering that the feast of the Roman
Chair should be observed on Jan. 18, while Gregory
XIII restored Feb. 22 as the feast of the Chair at
Antioch. This is not the place to discuss whether
there was, properly speaking, any episcopate of
St Peter at Antioch. It is significant that the
churches of Greece and the East knew nothing of
the feast of St Peter’s Chair at Antioch<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p><b>St Peter ‘ad vincula,’</b> ‘St Peter’s Chains.’
The Eastern Church celebrates the festival of
<i>St Peter’s Chain</i> on Jan. 16; the Latin Church
celebrates the corresponding festival on Aug. 1.
Both festivals not improbably had their origins in
the dedication of churches, where what were supposed
to be a chain or chains which had bound Peter were
preserved. The plural, ‘chains,’ in the Roman name
is significant, and will be understood by reference
to the 4th and 5th Lections for the feast in the
Roman Breviary. The feast does not appear in
Western Kalendars till the eighth century.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century building, S. Pietro in
Vincoli, on the Esquiline, occupies the site of the
church of the Apostles, reconstructed at the expense
of the imperial family between <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 432 and <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 440,
where the precious relics were deposited.</p>

<p>In connexion with this feast attention should be
called to the fact that in the so-called Hieronymian
Martyrology at Aug. 1, we find no reference to the
chains, but there is the particularly interesting entry:
‘At Rome, dedication of the first church both constructed
and consecrated by blessed Peter the
Apostle<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.’</p>

<p><b>St Andrew</b> (Nov. 30). The Martyrologies agree
in giving Nov. 30 as the day of the martyrdom. The
festival appeared early at Rome, and was given a
place of high dignity<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>. In fact there is authority for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the feast being kept at Rome in early times with no
less solemnity than St Peter’s Day. It will be remembered
that in the prayer <i>Libera nos</i> in the
Canon of the Mass Andrew is named together with
Peter and Paul. The Sacramentary of St Leo has
four sets of ‘propers’ for masses on this festival. It
is a day of much importance in the Greek Church,
as St Andrew, the Protoclete, is reckoned the apostle
of Greece. St Andrew is the patron of the Russian
Church<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>. Relics of St Andrew, said to have been
brought by a monk named Regulus from Patras to
Scotland, gave the name of St Andrew to the place in
Fife previously known as Kilrymont; and St Andrew
became the patron saint of Scotland. In the
Aberdeen Breviary his day is a ‘greater double.’</p>

<p>Bishop Wordsworth remarks that St Andrew’s
Day ‘is perhaps the only festival of an Apostle
claiming to be really on the anniversary of his death.’
Nov. 30 is given as the day of his martyrdom in
the apocryphal <i>Acta Andreae</i>, describing his death
at Patras<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.</p>

<p><b>St James the Great</b> (July 25), the son of
Zebedee, does not appear very early. The day is not
noticed in either the Leonine or the Gelasian Sacramentary,
and made its way to general acceptance
but slowly. In the canons of the Council of Oxford
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1222) it does not appear among the chief
festivals for general observance in England, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in England it was certainly a <i>festum chori</i> long before
that date.</p>

<p>It would seem (Acts xii. 2, 3) that the death of
James took place about the time of the Paschal commemoration;
the Coptic Kalendar marks St James’s
day on April 12, and the Syrian lectionary of Antioch
on April 30, on which day also the Greek Church
keeps a festival of St James, using for the Epistle
Acts xii. 1, etc. The placing of the festival in the
West so far from Easter as July 25, suggests that
the latter date was connected with some translation
of relics, or such like.</p>

<p>As we have already seen (p. 16) the ancient Syriac
Kalendar edited originally by Wright, commemorates
James together with his brother John on Dec. 27.</p>

<p><b>St John, Apostle and Evangelist.</b> The
principal festival on Dec. 27 is found in the fourth
century in the East, where he was conjoined with
James. Traces of this conjunction are to be found
in the West. It is interesting to find in the Gothic
Missal, printed by Muratori, a mass for the Natale
of the Apostles James and John placed between
St Stephen and Holy Innocents. And in the Hieronymian
Martyrology we find at Dec. 27 ‘the ordination
to the episcopate of St James, the Lord’s brother
[a confusion], and the assumption of St John, the
Evangelist, at Ephesus.’</p>

<p>The Greek Church commemorates the <i>metastasis</i>,
or migration of John, on Sept. 26, and an important
festival in honour of the holy dust (called <i>manna</i>)
from his tomb at Ephesus on May 8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p><b>St John before the Latin gate</b> (May 6).
The story of the caldron of boiling oil is as old as
Tertullian (<i>de Praescript.</i> c. 36). But of the festival
there is no notice before the closing years of the
eighth century. The day of the month probably
marks the date of the dedication of a church near
the Latin gate<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. It is characteristically a Western
festival. In the Roman rite it was, about the
thirteenth century, a semi-double: it was made a
double by Pius V (1566-1572), and a greater double
by Clement VIII (1592-1605).</p>

<p><b>St Matthew</b> (Sept. 21): in the Greek, Russian,
Syrian and Armenian Churches, Nov. 16: in the
Egyptian and Ethiopic Kalendars of Ludolf, Oct. 9.
The festival of Sept. 21 is certainly late in appearing.
It is wanting in the Leonine, Gelasian, and Gallican
Sacramentaries, and in Muratori’s edition of the
Gregorian. It is found, however, generally in the
martyrologies, which fact, of course, does not
necessarily imply that there was any liturgical
observance of the day<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>.</p>

<p><b>St Luke</b> (Oct. 18); and on the same day
generally in the East. The day perhaps marks a
translation of relics in the East, as is stated in the
so-called Hieronymian Martyrology. St Luke does
not appear in the older Sacramentaries; but in some
manuscripts of the Gregorian we find a proper
preface for St Luke on v Kal. Nov. (Oct. 28).</p>

<p><b>St Mark</b> (April 25): on the same day in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
East. The day is of late appearance, not perhaps
before the ninth century. The great processional
litanies on April 25 appear at Rome long before
St Mark’s name was attached to the day. In their
origin these litanies were distinctively Roman.</p>

<p><b>St Philip and St James</b> (May 1). This was
the day of the dedication of a church at Rome in
their honour in the second half of the sixth century.
The word <i>natale</i> is applied at a later time to the
day; which may have been in error, or, as can be
proved by many examples, the word <i>natale</i> came
to be used loosely as equivalent to festival or commemoration.
In the Greek Church St James, ‘the
brother of God,’ is commemorated on Oct. 23, and
St Philip, ‘one of the twelve,’ on Nov. 14. The
Greeks celebrate Philip, the deacon, on Oct. 11, and
he appears in Usuard’s Martyrology at June 6.</p>

<p>Why Philip and James should be associated we
know not. The deposition of relics of both at the
time of the dedication of the church at Rome may
perhaps account for the conjunction of the names.</p>

<p><b>St Simon and St Jude</b> (Oct. 28). Legend
associates these two Apostles as having together
laboured for thirteen years in Persia, and as there
dying martyrs’ deaths. In the Sacramentaries they
do not appear till they are found in a late form of
the Gregorian. In the East the commemoration of
these Apostles is divided and a day assigned to each.
In the Greek Church Simon Zelotes appears at
May 10, and Judas (Thaddaeus) at June 19.</p>

<p><b>St Thomas, Apostle and Martyr</b> (Dec. 21);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his Translation is marked at July 3 in the West.
In the Greek Church St Thomas is commemorated
on Oct. 6, a day also observed by the Syrians, who
add a translation on July 3. In the fourth century
there was a magnificent basilica of St Thomas at
Edessa, and to this church the remains of the Apostle
were translated (from India according to the legend)
before the close of the century. St Thomas (at
Dec. 21) is not found in the Leonine, and only in
some texts of the Gregorian Sacramentary. He
appears, however, in the Gelasian.</p>

<p><b>St Bartholomew</b> (Aug. 24); and at Rome on
Aug. 25. The Latin churches generally, including
that of mediaeval England, observed Aug. 24. The
Greek Church commemorates Bartholomew together
with Barnabas on June 11, and a translation of the
relics of Bartholomew on Aug. 25. In the West
the introduction of the feast was late. There is
no trace of it in the early forms of the great
Sacramentaries<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<p><b>St John the Baptist, the Nativity</b> (June 24);
so too in the Greek Church. The date was doubtless
assigned on the strength of the inference drawn from
the Gospels, that the birth of the baptist preceded
that of the Saviour by six months. It appeared
early, and was a recognised day in the time of
St Augustine<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>. It has its masses in the Sacramentaries
from the Leonine downwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><b>The Decollation of St John the Baptist</b>
(generally Aug. 29). This festival is also early, but,
so far as evidence goes, not so early as the Nativity<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>.
It was known in Gaul before it was adopted at Rome.
The Greek churches celebrate the day on Aug. 29<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>.</p>

<p><b>The Conversion of St Paul</b> (Jan. 25), was of
late introduction. It does not appear in the correct
text of Bede’s Martyrology, and in only late texts
of the Gregorian Sacramentary. There is reason for
believing that the day was first observed to mark
the translation of relics of St Paul at Rome, for so
it appears in the Hieronymian Martyrology, and the
period of transition seems to be marked in the
Martyrology of Rabanus Maurus (ninth century),
where we find at Jan. 25, ‘Translation and Conversion
of St Paul.’ It is not found in England in
the Pontifical of Egbert, Archbishop of York (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
732-766), but it appears in the Leofric Missal, in
the second half of the eleventh century. It is
unknown in the Greek Church.</p>

<p><b>St Mary Magdalene</b> (July 22), who is identified
in the West with the woman who was a sinner,
and with Mary the sister of Lazarus, is distinguished
from each of these in the Greek service-books which
also mark her festival on July 22. Among the
Easterns she is thought of as ‘the holy myrrh-bearer,’
one of the women who brought the spices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to the tomb of the Lord. In various places in the
West, though not at Rome, the day was a day of
obligation in the middle ages. It appears in some
service-books in the tenth and eleventh centuries,
but not in missals, <i>secundum consuetudinem Romanae
curiae</i>, till the thirteenth<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<p>There was a festival of St Mary Magdalene
(July 22) in the English Prayer Book of 1549. The
collect and gospel (Luke vii. 36 to the end of the
chapter) show that no English Reformers identified
the Magdalene with the woman who was a sinner.
The festival disappears in the Prayer Book of 1552.</p>

<p><b>St Barnabas, the Apostle</b> (June 11). The
Greeks commemorate on this day ‘Bartholomew and
Barnabas, Apostles.’ The festival probably marks
the supposed finding of the body of Barnabas (having
a copy of St Matthew’s Gospel in his hand) in the
island of Cyprus in the fifth century. Barnabas is
not found at June 11 in the so-called Hieronymian
Martyrology; nor in the Martyrology known as
<i>Gellonense</i>, but it is noted in Bede (though there is
some doubt whether the entry is not due to Florus),
and in the later Martyrologies.</p>

<p>The Greek Church commemorates (many of them
with proper names attached) the seventy disciples
of Luke x. 1, called in the service-books ‘apostles.’</p>

<p><b>Octaves.</b> The word Octave is used sometimes
for the eighth day after a festival, sometimes (in
later documents) for the space of eight days which
follow the festival. It may be regarded as an echo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
or prolongation of the festival. In the Eastern
Church what is known as the <i>Apodosis</i> (see p. 135)
in a measure corresponds to the Western Octave.
It has not unreasonably been conjectured that they
owe their origin to an imitation of the festal practices
of the Hebrews (Levit. xxiii. 6; Num. xxviii. 17;
Deut. xvi. 3). Octaves were originally few: they
appear first in connexion with Easter and Pentecost,
and, occasionally, with the Epiphany. In the eighth
and ninth centuries Octaves became more numerous.
Yet in the Corbie Kalendar (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 826), assuming
that the movable feasts of Easter and Pentecost had
their Octaves, we find in addition only the Octaves
of Christmas, Epiphany, Peter and Paul, Lawrence
and Andrew. This falls in well with what is said
by Amalarius (about the same date) who, after
noticing the Octaves of Christmas, Epiphany, Easter,
and Pentecost, adds, ‘We are accustomed to celebrate
the Octaves of the <i>natalitia</i> of some saints, that is,
of those whose festivals are esteemed as more illustrious
amongst us’ (<i>De ecclesiasticis officiis</i>, iv. 36).
At Rome we find St Agnes having an Octave (Jan.
28) at a date earlier than that with which we have
been dealing<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>; and even to-day in the Roman Missal
and Breviary there is an interesting survival in the
persistence of the old name, <i>Agnetis secundo</i>, and
of ‘propers’ for the day. Liturgically, the ancient
practice in the West was to insert a simple commemoration
on the eighth day of festivals.</p>

<p>The prolongation of a festival for eight days may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
be found illustrated by the practice of the Church
at Jerusalem in the fourth century, as recounted by
‘Silvia’ in her descriptions of the Epiphany, the
Pascha, and the feast of the dedication of the churches
known as the Martyrium and the Church of the
Resurrection.</p>

<p>The great multiplication of Octaves in mediaeval
times has been attributed to the influence of the
Franciscans, who in the language of Kellner ‘provided
an inordinate number of Octaves in their Breviary,
and observed each day of the Octave with the rite
of a <i>festum duplex</i><a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>.’</p>

<p>The somewhat elaborate rules with respect to
Octaves and their relation to the observance of other
festivals, as enjoined in the modern Roman rite, can
be found in such technical works as those of Gavantus
and Ferraris. It must suffice here to observe that
within the Octaves of Christmas, Easter, Pentecost,
the Epiphany, and Corpus Christi, Votive and Requiem
masses are prohibited.</p>

<p><b>Vigils.</b> The origin of vigils is obscure. The
proper service of each Lord’s Day was preceded in
early times by what may be regarded as something
like a vigil, a service before the dawn of day; and
some think that this view may be deduced from
Pliny’s well-known letter to Trajan. But in this
there would seem, perhaps, to be a reading into the
document of more than its contents warrant. However
this may be, we find as early as Tertullian that
there were among Christians ‘nocturnae convocationes,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the solemnities of the Pascha being more
particularly referred to<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. The exact nature and object
of these assemblies are not described. Evidence is
more full at a later date for vigils of some kind, not
only before the Lord’s Day but also before the Sabbath<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.
At the period when ‘Silvia’ visited Jerusalem
the faithful seem to have engaged in services before
the dawn on every Lord’s Day. And in Gaul in the
fifth century, as we gather from Sidonius Apollinaris<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>,
the vigils were not all night-watches but services
before day-break. About a century later than
Tertullian, we find the Council of Elvira, near
Granada, some time in the first quarter of the fourth
century, enacting a canon (35), declaring that women
should not spend the night-watches (<i>pervigilent</i>)
in cemeteries, ‘because often under the pretext
of prayer they secretly commit serious offences
(<i>scelera</i>).’ There is no further explanation; and
the probable conjecture has been offered that it may
have been the practice to have vigils in the cemeteries
on the night before the oblation was offered at the
tomb of one of the martyrs. That there was in
Spain at this date some kind of service in the
cemeteries seems not improbable from the fact that
the canon immediately preceding that which we
have noticed forbids the lighting of wax tapers in
cemeteries in the day time.</p>

<p>By the end of the fourth century, there is ample<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
evidence for the observance of nocturnal or early
morning vigils before the greater festivals in both
East and West. Early in the fifth century Vigilantius
protested against the scandals which arose
from the nocturnal watchings in the basilicas, and
for this, among other assaults upon the current
abuses and superstitions of the time, he drew upon
himself the violent and coarse invective of Jerome.
Yet Jerome himself may be quoted for the fact that
there were moral dangers attending these nocturnal
vigils, for while advising the lady Laeta to inure her
daughter, the younger Paula, to days of vigil and
solemn pernoctations, he warns her that she should
keep the girl close by her side<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>. To Pope Boniface I
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 418-422) has been attributed the prohibition
of nocturnal vigils in the Roman cemeteries.</p>

<p>With regard to the Paschal Vigil, Jerome expresses
the opinion that it originated in the belief
that Christ would come again in the night of the
Pascha<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p>In process of time, the day before the feast
(<i>dies profestus</i>) assumed the name of vigil, and was
in the West commonly, though not universally,
associated with a fast. Mediaeval ritualists, such
as Honorius of Autun (who died a little after <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
1130), connect the change with the popular abuses
of the nocturnal vigils.</p>

<p>There is an interesting letter of Innocent III
(about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1213), laying down the rule in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Roman Church, which still prevails. The vigils of
the Apostles are to be observed as fasts, with the
exception of St John the Evangelist and St Philip
and St James, the former occurring in the season of
Christmas, and the latter in that of Easter<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. Beside
the vigils of the Apostles, the vigils of Christmas
and the Assumption are fasts <i>de jure</i>, and by
custom the vigils of Pentecost, the Nativity of
the Baptist, St Lawrence, and All Saints. These
rules were often locally modified by papal indults.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">SEASONS OF PREPARATION AND PENITENCE</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Advent</span></h3>

<p>Advent, as the term is now employed, signifies
a season, regarded as preparatory to the Festival
of the Nativity of the Lord, including four Sundays
and a variable number of days, as affected by the
day of the week upon which December 25 falls.</p>

<p>As no evidence has been adduced for an established
celebration of the Feast of the Nativity before
the fourth century, so it is obvious that we cannot
expect to find the appointment of a season of preparation
before that date. As a matter of fact, it
would seem that the earliest distinct notice of such
a season, prescribed for general use, belongs to the
latter part of the sixth century; and that the practice
originated in Gaul. In a small council held at
Tours about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 567 there is vaguely indicated a
fast <i>for monks</i> in December, to be kept every day
‘usque ad natale domini’ (can. 17). A few years
later, in the south of Gaul, we find what seems a
canon of general application, but less exacting in
regard to the number of days on which the fast was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to be observed. In the ninth canon of the Council
of Mâcon (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 581) it is enjoined that from the
festival of St Martin (Nov. 11) the second, fourth
and sixth days of the week should be fasting days,
that the sacrifices should be celebrated in the quadragesimal
order, and that on these days the canons
(probably meaning the canons of this synod) should
be read, so that no one could plead that he erred
through ignorance. We have here something that
at once reminds us of the pre-paschal season, as
observed in some Churches. The season came to
be known as <i>Quadragesima S. Martini</i>. But the
length of this season (as was also true of Lent) seems
to have varied much. The six Sundays which it
covered, as we may infer from the canon of Mâcon
referred to above, we find indicated probably by the
six <i>missae</i> of Sundays of Advent in the Ambrosian
and Mozarabic rites. Yet the oldest Gallican Sacramentary
records only three Sundays, and the Gothic-Gallican
only two<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p>In England, as we learn from Bede, forty days
of fasting ‘ante natale domini’ were observed by
Cuthbert († 687) and by Ecbert († 729). In both
cases, however, it should be remarked, the observance
seems mentioned as an indication of exceptional
piety<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>.</p>

<p>At the close of the sixth century Rome, under
Gregory the Great, adopted the rule of the four
Sundays in Advent; and in the following century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
this rule became prevalent (though not universal)
in the West.</p>

<p>In the Greek Church the general observance of
forty days’ penitential preparation for Christmas does
not appear to have been established before the thirteenth
century. In the Greek Church of to-day the
forty days’ preparation begins on Nov. 15. It is
sometimes called the Fast of St Philip, doubtless
because the festival of St Philip was celebrated on
Nov. 14. On Wednesdays and Fridays the fast is
rigorous; but on other days, wine, oil, and fish are
allowed.</p>

<p>The practice of the Armenians is peculiar: they
observe a fast for the week preceding the Nativity,
and for one week commencing fifty days before the
Nativity. The conjecture has been offered that
these two weeks are a survival of a fast that had
originally lasted for the whole of fifty days.</p>

<p>In Churches of the Roman Communion at the
present day, the practice as to fasting varies. In
Great Britain and Ireland Wednesdays and Fridays
are expected to be observed; but in many parts of
the continent of Europe there is no distinction between
weeks in Advent and ordinary weeks.</p>

<p>On December 16 in the West it was the practice
to sing as an antiphon to the Magnificat the first
of a series of seven antiphons, each beginning with
‘O’; thus, ‘O Sapientia’ (Dec. 16), ‘O Adonai’ (17),
‘O Radix Jesse’ (18), etc. In the Kalendar of the
Book of Common Prayer the words ‘O Sapientia’
appear at Dec. 16. This is not, strictly speaking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a <i>survival</i> of mediaeval times; for it was first introduced
into the English Prayer Book Kalendar in
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1604.</p>

<p>The rule of the English Book of Common Prayer
(1662) for determining Advent runs thus: ‘Advent
Sunday is always the nearest Sunday to the Feast
of St Andrew, whether before or after.’ As thus
expressed, the rule does not seem to contemplate
the case of Advent Sunday falling on St Andrew’s
Day. It was a mistake not to add the additional
words which were in the Scottish Prayer Book of
1637, namely, ‘or that Sunday which falleth upon
any day from the twenty-seventh of November
to the third of December inclusively.’ The word
‘or’ does not imply that the second part of the
rule is an equivalent of the first; but it gives a
rule to meet a case not contemplated in the first
part.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Fast preceding Easter (Lent)</span></h3>

<p>That a fast preliminary to the Pascha was observed
in the early Church is beyond question.
Irenaeus, in his letter to Victor, bishop of Rome<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>,
states that at the time there were several differences
as to the length of the fast; but in no case was
a prolonged series of days prescribed. ‘Some,’ he
says, ‘think they ought to fast one day; others,
two; others more than two; others reckon together
forty hours both of the day and the night as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
day [of fasting]<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.’ And Irenaeus adds that these
differences existed long before (πολὺ πρότερον) the
time when he wrote. The words about the forty
hours may perhaps be illustrated by passages of
Tertullian<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>, where he speaks of persons fasting in
the days ‘when the bridegroom was taken away,’
or, in other words, the time during which the Lord
was under the power of death, <i>i.e.</i> certain hours of
the day of the Crucifixion, the twenty-four hours
of Saturday, and certain hours of the early part of
Easter Day. We shall not delay to discuss the
questions connected with the exact time of commencing
and of closing the forty hours.</p>

<p>About the middle of the third century at Alexandria
the whole week before Easter was observed
as a time of fasting by some; but there were those
who fasted only on four days; others contented
themselves with three or even two; while there were
some (evidently exceptional persons) who did not
fast even one day<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>. It is plain that as yet no fixed
rule was enforced.</p>

<p>In the fourth century we meet with the term
τεσσαρακοστή, or Quadragesima. In the fifth canon
of the Council of Nicaea it is ordered that one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the two annual provincial Synods should be held
before ‘the tessarakoste.’ The sense of the term
is assumed to be known, and is not explained. But
it must not be inferred that the word necessarily
signifies here forty <i>days</i>, or that forty <i>days</i> were
assigned to fasting.</p>

<p>The classical authority for the variations of later
usages is the passage of Socrates<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>, where he describes
many differences of practice in his own day (<i>c.</i> <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span>
440) and the varieties in the length of the fast in
different countries. At Rome, he says, there was a
fast of three weeks, excepting Saturdays and Sundays;
at Alexandria and in Achaia and Illyricum
a fast of six weeks; in other places the fast began
seven weeks before Easter, but was limited to fifteen
days, with an interval between each five days<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. Not
long after his time there were two prevailing usages—that
of the Churches which deducted from the
fasting days Sundays and Saturdays (always excepting
the Saturday in Holy Week), and that of the
Churches which deducted only the Sundays. The
former was the prevailing usage in the East; the
latter, in the West. The seven weeks in the East,
with thirteen days deducted (seven Sundays and six
Saturdays), and the six weeks of the West, with only
six days deducted, agree precisely in each having
only thirty-six fasting days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of the <i>Peregrinatio Silviae</i> (about
the end of the fourth century), if we may trust the
writer, at Jerusalem eight weeks of fasting preceded
Easter, which, deducting eight Sundays and seven
Saturdays, gave, as she expressly says, forty-one
days of fasting. This is highly exceptional, if not
unique. At any rate, the practice did not long
continue.</p>

<p>The number 36 is nearly the tenth of 365—the
number of the days of the year; and this thought
struck the fancy of more than one writer. We were
bound, they urged, to offer to God the holy tithe,
not only of our increase, but of our time. And in
the fifth century John Cassian presses this point,
and attempts to bring the length of the fast to
correspond more closely with the tithe of the year
by observing that the fast was prolonged for some
hours, ‘usque in gallorum cantum,’ on Easter
morning<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>.</p>

<p>At a later period the thought of the fasts of
Moses and Elijah, and more particularly of the
Lord’s fast of forty days in the wilderness, seems to
have suggested that the fast of the faithful should
correspond in length. The addition of four days—the
Wednesday and three following days immediately
preceding the first Sunday in Lent—has been
frequently attributed to Gregory the Great. But
the writings of Gregory testify to his knowing only
thirty-six fasting days. And it is now generally
acknowledged that no support for the supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
can be based on the language of the collects for
Feria IV and Feria VI in the week begun on Quinquagesima,
which speak of the beginning of the fast,
and are to be found in the Gregorian Sacramentary<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.
The Sacramentary, as we now possess it, abounds in
additions later than the time of Gregory.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say precisely when, or by whom,
the additional four days were introduced. Approximately
we may assign this change to about the
beginning of the eighth century, and to Rome. It
did not obtain everywhere. It was not till near
the close of the eleventh century that the Scottish
Church, at the persuasion of the Saxon princess,
Queen Margaret of Scotland, fell into line with most
of the other Western Churches, by accepting the four
fasting days in the week before the first Sunday in
Lent<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. The Mozarabic Liturgy adopted it only at
the instance of Cardinal Ximenes about the beginning
of the sixteenth century. The Church of Milan
still preserves, among its interesting survivals, the
commencement of the rigorous Lenten Fast on the
Monday after the first Sunday. But in 1563 St
Charles Borromeo, then archbishop of Milan, succeeded,
against vigorous local protests, in making
the first Sunday in Lent a day of abstinence.</p>

<p>The term <i>caput jejunii</i> was applied sometimes to
the Wednesday, known as Ash Wednesday, and frequently
in service-books to the period of the four
days preceding the first Sunday in Lent. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
these days are designated ‘Feria IV, Feria V, Feria
VI, et Sabbatum, in capite jejunii.’ The distribution
of ashes on the Wednesday in the Western Church
is a much modified survival and relic of the ancient
penitential discipline.</p>

<p>In the Orthodox Church of the East at the
present day ‘the great and holy Tessarakoste’ contains,
as in the West, six Sundays. But the Lenten
offices commence at Vespers on the Sunday (known
as Tyrinis, or Tyrophagus) preceding the first Sunday
in Lent. In the week preceding this Sunday (corresponding
to the Western Quinquagesima) the faithful
give up the use of flesh meat, and confine themselves
to cheese (τυρός) and other <i>lacticinia</i>. And it may
be observed, in passing, that in the Greek Church
there are other examples of the week being named
from the Sunday which <i>follows</i> it. Thus, ‘the week
of Palms’ is the week <i>followed</i> by Palm Sunday<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.
The Sunday (our Sexagesima) preceding <i>Tyrinis</i> is
called <i>Apocreos</i> (<i>Dominica carnisprivii</i>). It is the
last day upon which flesh may be eaten. After the
Sunday ‘Tyrinis’ a more rigorous fast is prescribed;
but Sundays and Saturdays (except the Saturday in
Holy week) are exempted, so that there are only
thirty-six days of rigid fasting; five days in each
of the first six weeks, and six days in the last week<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p>The word <i>quadragesima</i> is the source of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Italian <i>quaresima</i>, and the French <i>carême</i> (in old
French, <i>quaresme</i>); while our English word, <i>Lent</i>,
is simply indicative of the season of the year when
the fast occurs, being derived from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>Lencten</i>, the spring-time.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Other Special Times of Fasting</span></h3>

<h4>I. <i>Western Church—The three fasts called ‘Quadragesima’;
Rogation Days; the Four Seasons.</i></h4>

<p>In addition to Advent, which, as we have seen, is
sometimes spoken of as the <i>quadragesima of St
Martin</i>, and Lent (<i>quadragesima ante Pascha</i>)<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>, we
find in the eighth, ninth and tenth centuries in
writers of Germany, France, Britain, and Ireland
references to a third <i>quadragesima</i> which is styled
sometimes the <i>quadragesima</i> after Pentecost, and
sometimes the <i>quadragesima</i> before St John the
Baptist. In the <i>Paenitentiale</i> of Theodore, Archbishop
of Canterbury († <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 690), it is declared that
‘there are three fasts established by law (<i>jejunia
legitima</i>) for the people generally (<i>per populum</i>)<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>,
forty days and nights before Pascha, when we pay
the tithes of the year, and forty before the Nativity
of the Lord, and forty after Pentecost<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>.’ The remarkable
collection of canons of the ancient Irish Church,
which is known as the <i>Hibernensis</i>, is of uncertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
date, but is attributed by such eminent authorities
as Wasserschleben, Henry Bradshaw, Whitley Stokes,
and J. B. Bury, to the end of the seventh or early
part of the eighth century. The three penitential
seasons called <i>quadragesima</i> are distinctly referred
to<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. In the <i>Capitula</i> of Charlemagne, priests are
directed to announce to the people that these three
seasons are <i>legitima jejunia</i>. In the canons collected
by Burchard, Bishop of Worms (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1006), the three
seasons called <i>quadragesima</i> are referred to, and the
third is defined as the forty days before the festival
of St John the Baptist. Many interesting questions
are suggested by these passages with which we are
unable to deal here. It must suffice to say that the
<i>quadragesima</i> after Pentecost did not long survive.
It disappeared, and has left no mark upon the
Church’s year.</p>

<p><b>Rogation Days.</b> There is a general agreement
that the observance of the Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday before the Ascension as days of special
prayer and fasting, owes its origin to Mamertus,
bishop of Vienne (about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 470), who appointed
litanies or rogations to be said, at a time when the
people of his city were in great terror by reason
of a severe earthquake and a conflagration consequent
thereupon. The shaken walls and the
destruction of public buildings, as vividly described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by Sidonius Apollinaris, may have suggested practical
reasons for the litanies being chanted out of
doors. The practice of Rogations soon spread
through the whole of Gaul, and in the Council of
Orleans (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 511), where thirty-two bishops were
present, the three days’ fast, with Rogations, was
enjoined upon all their churches. In England, the
practice of observing the Rogations had evidently
been long established when the Council of Cloveshoe
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 747) enjoined it ‘according to the custom of
our predecessors.’ At Rome, in the opinion of
Baillet, and recently of Duchesne, the Rogation
days were not introduced till about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 800<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<p>In the East there is nothing corresponding to the
Rogation Days; and the ordinary fast of Wednesday
is on the Wednesday before Ascension Day relaxed
by a dispensation for oil, wine, and fish; for in the
East the <i>dies profestus</i> commonly possesses something
of a festal character, anticipatory of the morrow.</p>

<p>In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the term ‘gang-days’
is used more than once for the Rogation days;
and in the Laws of Athelstan we find ‘gang-days’ and
‘gang-week.’ The name originated in the walking
in procession on these days.</p>

<p><b>The Fasts of the Four Seasons</b> (<i>jejunia
quatuor temporum</i>). The earliest distinct reference to
these fasts is to be found in the Sermons of Pope Leo I
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 440-461), who speaks of the spring fast being
in Lent, the summer fast ‘in Pentecost,’ the autumn
fast in the seventh, and the winter fast in the tenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
month. From St Leo we also learn that the fast was
on Wednesday and Friday, and that on the Saturday
a vigil was observed at St Peter’s<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. The observance
is characteristically Roman, and is found at first only
at Rome, and in Churches in immediate dependence
on Rome. Duchesne holds that the weeks in which
these fasts occurred differed from other weeks mainly
in the rigour of the fast, <i>i.e.</i> ‘the substitution of a
real fast for the half-fast of the ordinary stations.’
And he adds the suggestion that on the Wednesday
of the Four Seasons, if not on the Friday, the Eucharist
was from the outset celebrated<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>.</p>

<p>In England the Council of Cloveshoe (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 747)
enjoins that no one should neglect ‘the fasts of the
fourth, seventh, and tenth month.’ The omission
of any notice of the Ember days in Lent will be
noticed later on.</p>

<p>In the Churches of Gaul we do not find the
Ember days established long before the time of
Charlemagne.</p>

<p>At first we find no trace of a connexion between the
Ember seasons and the holding of ordinations; and,
as is observed by Dr Sinker, ‘everything points to the
conclusion that the solemnity attaching to the seasons
led to their being chosen as fitting times for the
rite<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Sacramentary that is known as St Leo’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
exhibits ‘propers’ for masses of the fasts in the
fourth, seventh, and tenth months, <i>i.e.</i> June, September
and December<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>; and from these we can
gather that on ‘the festival of the fasts’ assemblies
and processions had been made on the Wednesdays
and Fridays, and a vigil (with the Eucharist) held
on the Saturdays. In these there is not only no
reference to ordinations of the clergy, but also no
reference that would suggest the special intention
and significance of these days of fasting. The conjecture
is not unreasonable that there was the desire
to dedicate in penitence the year in its four several
parts to the service of God; but neither the history
nor the literature of the early Church is decisive in
confirming the conjecture.</p>

<p>The practice of the Church at Rome spread
gradually, with some varieties as to the particular
weeks in which the three days of fasting were observed.
For England the notices of the Ember days
are earlier than they are for France. At first, at
Rome, the spring fast seems to have been in the
first week in March, but afterwards always in Lent.
And as soon as it came to be observed in Lent it
would (as regards the fast) require no special injunction.
This may perhaps account for the omission of
any mention of the fast of the first month in the
canon of the Council of Cloveshoe referred to above.
The fixing of the particular days now observed in the
West is generally assigned to about the close of the
eleventh century; but in England, as late as <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1222,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the Council of Oxford still speaks of the fast in the
first week in March<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.</p>

<p>In the Eastern Church there is nothing corresponding
to the fasts of the Four Seasons.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>There is some uncertainty as to the etymology of our
English phrase ‘Ember Days.’ The weight of authority
is in favour of the derivation from the Old English words
<i>ymb</i>, ‘about,’ ‘round,’ and <i>ryne</i>, ‘course,’ ‘running’; but the
<i>New English Dictionary</i> (Oxford) adds that it is not wholly
impossible that the word may have been due to popular
etymology working upon some vulgar Latin corruption of
<i>quatuor tempora</i>, as the German <i>quatember</i>, ‘ember tide.’</p>

</div>

<h4>II. <i>Eastern Churches.</i></h4>

<p>The fasts before the Nativity and Easter have
been treated of under Advent and Lent. In the
Greek Church the season before Easter is called
‘the great Tessarakoste,’ for the word Tessarakoste
is also applied to three other penitential
seasons, (1) to the fast before the Lord’s Nativity,
(2) the fast of the Apostles (Peter and Paul), and
(3) the fast of the Assumption of the Theotokos.
But, though the word Tessarakoste is applied to
each of these, there is no apparent connexion between
the number <i>forty</i> and the number of days
observed as fasting-days; and this is notably the
case in regard to the third and fourth. The fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the Apostles extends for a variable number of
days from the Monday after the Sunday of All
Saints (<i>i.e.</i> the first Sunday after Pentecost) to
June 28, both inclusive.</p>

<p>Examination will show that the interval between
these two limits can very rarely amount to forty
days; and when Easter falls at its latest possible
date (April 25) the first Sunday after Pentecost is
June 20, so that the Tessarakoste of the Apostles
would in that case be only eight days in length.</p>

<p>The length of the Tessarakoste of the Assumption
is fixed, and extends only from Aug. 1 to
Aug. 14.</p>

<p>It would appear then that the term Tessarakoste
has come in practice to signify simply a fast of a
number of days, and has lost all reference to the
number 40.</p>

<p>The Exaltation of the Cross (Sept. 14), although
regarded as a festival (ἑορτή) of the highest dignity,
is observed as a strict fast.</p>

<p>The same is true of the Decollation of the Forerunner
(Aug. 29), because of ‘the murder of him
who is greater than all the prophets.’ When it is
remembered that all Wednesdays as well as Fridays
are fasting days, it will not be a surprise to be told
that the fasting days of the Greek Church amount
in each year to some 190 in number.</p>

<p>The Armenians on fast-days abstain from flesh,
milk, butter, eggs, and oil. Every day in Lent except
Sundays is kept as a fast. Among peculiar observances
is (1) the Fast of Nineveh, for two weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
commencing in the week before our Septuagesima.
It is called by the Armenians <i>Aratschavor-atz</i>,
meaning, it is said, ‘preceding abstinence,’ and this
term has taken shape among the Greeks as ‘Artziburion.’
In the frequent controversies between
the Greeks and Armenians the former denounce this
fast as execrable and satanic. (2) The Armenians
also observe as a fast the week after Pentecost. It
has been maintained that in early times this fast
was observed in the week before Pentecost, and that
afterwards, in compliance with the general rule that
the days between Easter and Pentecost should not
be observed as fasts, a change was made.</p>

<span class="smaller">WESTERN MEDIAEVAL KALENDARS:
MARTYROLOGIES</span></h2>

<p>The word <i>Martyrology</i> has been sometimes applied
to mere records of names placed opposite days of
the month, like the document which goes under
the name of Liberius (see p. 14), as well as to the
fuller and more elaborate accounts of saints and
martyrs, with often something of biographical detail,
and notices of time and place, and (in the case of
martyrs) the manner of the passions, such as are to
be found, for example, in the Martyrology of Bede,
and more particularly in the additions of Florus,
and the Martyrologies of Ado and Usuard.</p>

<p>The study of the Martyrologies is surrounded
by many difficulties. They were again and again
copied, and re-handled. It demands much knowledge
and critical acumen to sever from the documents
as they have come down to us later additions,
so that we may get at what may reasonably be regarded
as the original texts. Such work is always
attended with considerable uncertainty, and scholars
are often divided in opinion as to the results<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The influence of the later Martyrologies upon
the mediaeval Kalendars of the West is marked.
Bede’s valuable work is the outcome of honest and
patient research; many days, however, were left
blank—an offence to the professional Martyrologist.
It was much enlarged, about one hundred years after
his death, by one Florus, who (with some differences
of opinion) is generally supposed to have been a
sub-deacon of Lyons. Ado, bishop of Vienne, some
twenty or thirty years later than Florus, prepared
an extensive Martyrology, which, together with the
work of Florus, was in turn utilised and abridged
about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 875 by Usuard, a priest and Benedictine
monk of the monastery of St Germain-des-Prés, then
outside the walls of Paris, who undertook his work
at the instance of the Emperor Charles the Bald.
The book when completed was dedicated to the
Emperor; and before long Usuard’s Martyrology
came in general to supersede previous attempts of
the same kind. Its influence on subsequent mediaeval
Kalendars is unmistakeable. Usuard came to be
adopted almost universally for use.</p>

<p>In monasteries and cathedral churches it was
a common practice to read aloud each day, sometimes
in chapter, sometimes in choir, after Prime,
the part of the Martyrology which had reference to
the commemorations of the day or of the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
day, together with notices of obits and anniversaries
of members of the ecclesiastical corporation and of
benefactors, which on the following day would be
observed. Indeed, in later times the name Martyrology
is not infrequently applied to the mere lists
of such obits and anniversaries. The mediaeval
martyrologies are generally Usuard’s, but they have
local additions.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>The student who desires to know something of other
early Martyrologies, such as that which is called the
Hieronymian, the Lesser Roman, and the Martyrology
of Rabanus, bishop of Mainz, may consult Kellner
(pp. 401-410) and Mr Birk’s article, <i>Martyrology</i>, in
<i>D. C. A.</i> Since the publication of the latter article the
<i>Henry Bradshaw Society</i> has issued, under the competent
editorship of Mr Whitley Stokes, the metrical <i>Martyrology
of Oengus the Culdee</i> (about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 800) and the metrical
<i>Martyrology of Gorman</i> (latter part of the twelfth century),
which are of much value in illustrating the hagiology of
the Irish Church. The scanty materials for the study
of Scottish mediaeval Kalendars (all of them late) have
been gathered together by Bishop A. P. Forbes in his
<i>Kalendars of Scottish Saints</i>, 1872. The <i>Martiloge in
Englysshe</i> printed by Wynkyn de Worde (1526) and
reprinted by the <i>Henry Bradshaw Society</i> (1893) is the
Martyrology of the Church of Sarum, with many
additions.</p>

</div>

<p>By the tenth century the general features of
Kalendars throughout Europe are substantially
identical as regards the greater days of observance.
But differences, often of much interest, arise through
different churches commemorating saints of local
or national celebrity. It often happens that by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
this means alone we are able to determine, or to
conjecture with considerable probability, the place
or region where some liturgical manuscript had its
origin. When we find in a Kalendar a large proportion
of more or less obscure saints belonging to
the Rhine valley, we may be confident that the
manuscript belongs to that region of Germany.
When an English Kalendar contains no notice of
St Osmund we may be sure that it did not originate
at Salisbury. When we find St Margaret on Nov. 16,
St Fillan on Jan. 9, St Triduana on Oct. 8, and
St Regulus on March 30, there is an overwhelming
probability that the manuscript belongs to Scotland.
In the Kalendar of York we find St Aidan (Aug. 31),
St Hilda of Whitby (Aug. 25), and St Paulinus, the
archbishop (Oct. 10), but these are all wanting to
the Sarum Kalendar. St Kunnegund, the German
Empress, who died in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1040, figures largely in
German Kalendars. Sometimes we find marked not
only her obit, but her canonization, and her translation;
and at Bamberg the octave of her translation
was observed. Outside Germany she is all
but unknown. St Louis is naturally an important
personage in French Kalendars; and he appears as
far north as the Kalendars of Scandinavia. He never
obtained a place in any of the leading ‘uses’ of
England. On the other hand, at an earlier date
continental influences on ecclesiastical affairs (not
unknown before the Conquest) became potent when
Norman churchmen poured into this country after
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1066, and obtained places of the highest dignity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
It is thus probably that St Batildis, wife of Clovis II
(Jan. 30), St Sulpicius, bishop of Bourges (Jan. 17),
St Medard, bishop of Noyon, with St Gildard, bishop
of Rouen (June 8), and St Andoen, another bishop
of Rouen (Aug. 24), obtained days in our English
Kalendars. All these are absent from the Anglo-Saxon
Kalendars printed by Hampson<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.</p>

<p>Again, occasionally a Church Kalendar exhibits
features which may be attributed to merely accidental
circumstances. Relics of some saint belonging
to another and distant region may happen to have
been presented to some church; and thereupon his
name is inserted in its Kalendars. It is thus, with
much probability, that Mr Warren accounts for the
appearance of the names of one northern bishop and
two northern abbots—Aidan, bishop of Lindisfarne,—Benedict,
first abbot, and Ceolfrith, second abbot
of Wearmouth—in the Kalendar of the Leofric
Missal. In William of Malmesbury, we read that
in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 703 relics of these saints were brought to
Glastonbury. And in the case of two of these,
Aidan (Aug. 31) and Ceolfrith (Sept. 25), the
Leofric Kalendar adds to each name the word, ‘in
Glaestonia.’ Other evidence makes it all but certain
that Glastonbury and its history affected the Leofric
Kalendar. At Cologne, which claims to possess the
heads of the Three Kings, one cannot wonder that
their Translation (July 23) is a ‘summum festum.’
In the Kalendars of the Orthodox Church of the
East the deposition of relics is frequently the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of the annual commemoration of the event, and
the insertion of a festival in the Menology. In all
countries translations of the bodies of saints are
found entered; and when the dates of such translations
are known from history, we are at once enabled
to say of any particular manuscript service-book
that the Kalendar, in which some particular translation
is marked <i>prima manu</i>, was written after the
known date. On the other side, when we find any
important festival absent, or, as is frequently the
case, inserted in a later handwriting, the strong
presumption is raised that the original Kalendar
belongs to a time before the establishment of the
festival. Thus, the absence of the Conception of
St Mary (Dec. 8) from a Kalendar suggests that it
is earlier than the last quarter of the eleventh
century; while the appearance of Corpus Christi
goes to determine a Kalendar to be later than
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1260.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will seen that, even
apart from the style of the handwriting, the formation
of the various letters, the manner of punctuation,
and other palaeographical indications, the mere contents
of a Kalendar will often help the student to
make a good conjecture as to both the place of the
origin of a manuscript and the time when it was
penned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;" id="illus4">

<p class="caption">Kalendar of Durham Psalter (September)</p>
<p class="caption">Jesus College, Cambridge (MS. Q. B. 6). Cent. xii.</p>
</div>

<p>As regards the particular Church for the use of
which any Kalendar was intended, attention should
be directed not only to the appearance of certain
festivals, but to the rank and dignity of the festivals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
which are often indicated by some such notes as
‘principal,’ ‘of ix Lessons,’ ‘of iii Lessons,’ ‘greater
double,’ ‘lesser double,’ or some other term of classification<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>.
Classification in continental Kalendars is
often otherwise expressed<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>. In the Kalendar of the
Missal of Westminster Abbey the dignity of the
greater festivals is marked by indicating the number
of copes (varying from two to eight) which were to
be used, as has been thought, by the monks who
sang the Invitatory to <i>Venite</i> at Mattins. No one
will be surprised to learn that at Westminster the
Feast of St Edward the Confessor (Jan. 5), and his
Translation (Oct. 13) are marked ‘viii cape,’ a
dignity which is reached only in the cases of
St Peter and St Paul, the Assumption, All Saints,
and Christmas: while in the Sarum Kalendar St
Edward is marked on Jan. 5 only by a ‘memory,’
and his Translation is but a ‘lower double.’ At
Holyrood Abbey, near Edinburgh, Holy Cross Day
was naturally one of the greatest festivals of the
year, while in the Aberdeen Breviary the Invention
of the Cross and the Exaltation were both ‘lesser
doubles.’ At Hereford, Thomas of Hereford (Oct. 2)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was a ‘principal feast,’ and so was his Translation
(Oct. 25); neither day appears in the Sarum
Kalendar. The Translation of the Three Kings,
already referred to, which is a ‘summum festum’
at Cologne, is all but unknown elsewhere. These
examples will suffice for our purpose.</p>

<p>It remains to notice entries of other kinds not
uncommon in mediaeval Kalendars. There are notices
of what I may call an antiquarian kind, which did
not at all, or but seldom, affect the service of the
day, but which are not without an interest of their
own. Thus, such entries as the following are not
uncommon. ‘The first day of the world’ (March 18);
‘Adam was created’ (March 23); ‘Noah entered
the ark’ (March 17); ‘The Resurrection of the
Lord’ (March 27), by which is meant that the actual
resurrection of the Saviour took place on this day
of the month, in the year in which the Lord was
crucified. This assigned date is of great antiquity.
We find it in Tertullian (<i>adv. Judaeos</i> c. 8); and
later it was accepted by Hippolytus and Augustine,
and it is frequent in the Kalendars of the early
mediaeval period. In the Sarum Kalendar it is
marked as a principal feast of three lessons, but
there is no service answering to the day in the
Breviary. We find ‘Noah comes forth from the
ark’ (April 29); ‘The devil departs from the Lord’
(Feb. 15); ‘The Ascension of the Lord’ (May 5);
this last mentioned day is plainly a corollary to the
date assigned to the Resurrection, but it is not so
frequently inserted in the Kalendars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>We may pass without comment entries of astronomical
interest, such as ‘Sol in aquario,’ ‘Sol in
piscibus,’ and such like; the solstices and the equinoxes;
the days when the four seasons began; and
such weather-notes as the dates when the dog-days
(<i>dies caniculares</i>) began and ended. It will be observed
that there was at least ancient precedent for what
gave offence to Bishop Wren when he wrote of the
Kalendar of the Book of Common Prayer, ‘Out
with the dog-days from among the Saints.’</p>

<p>Some of the features just noticed continued to
make their appearance in various English Kalendars
after the Reformation. The Kalendar, indeed, of
the Prayer Book of 1549 looks to our eyes singularly
bare, with no days marked other than what we call
the red-letter festivals. In 1552, the ‘dog-days’
reappear, and also the astronomical notes as to dates
of the sun’s entrance into the various signs of the
zodiac. To these are added, for reasons of practical
convenience, the Term days. The Prayer Book of
1559 adds further the hours of the rising and setting
of the sun at the beginning of each month. In the
Primer of Edward VI (1553) the names of a very
large number of the old Saints’ Days are introduced,
and the convenient reminder of ‘Fish’ is placed at
the days preceding the Purification, St Matthias, the
Annunciation, St John Baptist, St Peter, St James,
St Bartholomew, St Matthew, St Simon and St Jude,
All Saints, St Andrew, St Thomas, and Christmas.
This Kalendar also, after the manner of many
mediaeval Kalendars, marks the first possible day for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Easter, and ‘first of the Ascension,’ ‘uttermost
Ascension,’ ‘first Pentecost,’ ‘uttermost Pentecost.’
In some of the unauthorised books of devotion issued
in Elizabeth’s reign we find some of the dates inferred
rightly or wrongly from the Scripture history,
which had long before appeared in mediaeval Kalendars,
such as days connected with Noah’s story, the
Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension of the Lord;
and to these many other days of historical interest
are added<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>In many of the mediaeval Kalendars we find
entered at Jan. 28, March 11, and April 15, respectively,
the words ‘Claves Quadragesimae,’ ‘Claves
Paschae,’ and ‘Claves Rogationum.’ The number
of days to be counted from each of these dates to
the beginning of Lent, to Easter, and to the Rogation
Days, varying according to the place which any given
year occupies in the Cycle of Golden Numbers, may
be found with the help of a table prefixed to the
Kalendar. It should be noted that the ‘terminus’
of the key never falls on the day of the fast or
festival sought, and if the terminus of the key for
Easter falls on a Sunday, Easter is the following
Sunday.</p>

<p>Several of the old Kalendars exhibit the days
on which ‘the months of the Egyptians’ and ‘the
months of the Greeks’ begin, with the names of these
several months. In some early English Kalendars
the Saxon names of the months are also inserted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
This feature may have been of use to historical
students, but having no bearing on ecclesiastical
life in the West it is passed over here without
further notice.</p>

<p>For a similar reason we do not describe the verses
frequently inserted at the various months, with advice
as to agricultural operations, blood-letting, rules
of health, and the unlucky, or Egyptian days.</p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>Occasionally attached to early Kalendars and Martyrologies
is to be found the Horologium or Shadow-clock—a
set of rules for determining, in a rough way, the hour
of the day by measuring one’s own shadow on the ground<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The modern Roman Martyrology was preceded
towards the close of the fifteenth century and in
the sixteenth century by several attempts to provide
what was thought to be a more serviceable work
than that of Usuard. Among the more remarkable
of these are the Martyrology of the Italian mathematician
Francesco Maurolico, and that of Pietro
Galesini, published first at Milan in the year 1577.
The latter work had the effect of making manifest
that there was need for the correction of the Roman
Martyrology. Gregory XIII appointed a commission
to deal with the subject. The result of the labours
of the commission was printed in 1584. Further
corrections were made by Cardinal Baronius; and
the work as revised by him is in substance the
modern Roman Martyrology<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>.</p>

<h3>I. <i>Paschal Controversies prior to the Council of
Nicaea.</i></h3>

<p>The commemoration of the Pascha is the first
annual Christian solemnity with which history makes
us acquainted. And it will be well that the student
should bear in mind that the term ‘Pascha’ was
used in early times to signify, more particularly, not
Easter (for which it was used in later times), but
the day of the Lord’s Crucifixion, more commonly
without, and sometimes together with, the succeeding
two days, including the day of the Resurrection.
But most commonly the word is employed in the
earlier literature of the subject to signify the commemoration
of the day of the Crucifixion, which was
generally held to have corresponded in the history
of the Passion to the day upon which the Paschal
lamb was sacrificed in the Jewish ritual<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to conceive that, even if
the Christian religion had taken its rise in circumstances
altogether dissimilar from those amid which
as a matter of history it actually emerged, there
would have been no commemoration of such great
events as the death and rising again of its Founder.
But the first disciples of Christ being Hebrews, and
their converts at first being also in a large measure
Hebrews, it was inevitable that the great Hebrew
festival of the Passover should take to itself a new
colouring and a new significance in Christian thought.
Thus we find St Paul speaking of Christ as ‘our
Pascha’ (<i>i.e.</i> Paschal victim), which ‘hath been sacrificed
for us’ (1 Cor. v. 7). And he adds, ‘therefore
let us keep the feast (<i>or</i> keep festival) not with the
old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and
wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity
and truth.’ It would indeed be unwarrantable
to infer from this passage that a Christian Pascha
was actually observed as a festival at the time when
St Paul wrote to the Corinthians. But it is obvious
that the passage is steeped in reminiscences of the
Hebrew festival, and that these are already receiving
a new complexion and a new meaning.</p>

<p>The observance of the Christian Pascha first
comes into marked prominence about the middle
of the second century. At that date it was everywhere
a recognised institution of the Church; but
there were differences between the Churches of proconsular
Asia (the Asia of the seven Churches of
the Apocalypse) and the Church at Rome and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
other places, as to the particular day upon which the
commemoration should be observed. The evidence
with regard to the early stages of the dispute is
scanty. Such details as we possess are not free from
obscurity and have been variously interpreted.</p>

<p>In a work like the present volume we can do
no more than lay before the student the results
which seem to us to have the greater weight of
probability in their favour.</p>

<p>The Asiatics, it would seem, began to celebrate
the festival of the Pascha on the fourteenth day of
the moon of the Hebrew month Nisan, the day upon
which the Jews put away all leaven from their houses
and slew the lamb of the Passover. On the whole,
the evidence seems to make for the Asiatic Christians
terminating the preceding fast on the evening of
that day, and on the same evening celebrating the
Paschal feast consisting of the Eucharist, accompanied,
perhaps, by the Agape. It was on the fourteenth
Nisan, according to the prevailing Asiatic belief, that
the Lord suffered death upon the cross, and in His
sacrifice became the true representative of the Paschal
lamb which had been his antitype. Foreign as it
must be to us with our habits of thought to conceive
of a festival being kept on the day of the Crucifixion
(that is, on the evening which was regarded as the
beginning of the following day), we must suppose
that the realisation of the blessings of the redemption
purchased by the Saviour’s blood <i>overtoned</i> (to borrow
a term from the art of music) the imaginative presentment
of the historical sufferings of the Cross.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Our own English term, ‘Good Friday,’ seems to have
originated with a similar way of regarding the facts<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be apparent
that, as the fourteenth day of the moon might fall
upon any day in the week, the commemoration of
the Resurrection, three days later, might also fall
upon any day of the week. At Rome, and in various
other places, the festival of the Resurrection was
always observed on a Sunday, because it was on the
first day of the week that the Saviour rose from the
dead. The Asiatics laid stress on the day of the
<i>month</i>—the lunar month—on which the Saviour
suffered: the Roman Church insisted that the sixth
day of the <i>week</i>, Friday, was the proper day for commemorating
the Crucifixion, and that the following
Sunday should be kept as the feast of the Resurrection.
Those who made the fourteenth day of the
moon to be necessarily the day for the celebration
of the Pascha were known as ‘Quartodecimans<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.’</p>

<p>The dispute was further complicated by the
difference with regard to the observance of the fast.
The Asiatics terminated their fast on the evening
of the day of the Crucifixion. The Romans continued
it till the morning of the day of the Resurrection.</p>

<p>The Asiatics claimed St John and St Philip, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Apostles, as the originators of the usage which they
followed; and at the close of the second century
they were able to recite a long list of holy bishops
and martyrs who had never deviated from the practice
of their Churches.</p>

<p>It was some time about the middle of the second
century that St Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna, the
personal disciple of St John, visited Rome, and conferred
with Anicetus, the bishop of that city, on this
and other subjects. On the Paschal question neither
bishop was convinced by the other; but it was agreed
that on such a matter it was not essential that there
should be uniformity. The discussion was carried
on with moderation, the two bishops received the
Eucharist together, and Anicetus, ‘out of reverence’
for Polycarp permitted him to act as celebrant in
his church<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.</p>

<p>The subject of the proper time for observing the
Christian Pascha continued to excite discussion;
and between <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 164 and 166, on the occasion of
disputes at Laodicea, a defence of the practice of
proconsular Asia came from the pen of one of the
bishops of that region, Melito, bishop of Sardis.
Unfortunately no remains of the work of Melito
survive of such a kind as would help us to understand
the writer’s argument, or to clear the difficulties
which surround the attempt to form a well
assured picture of the practice of his part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Christian world. It has indeed been conjectured
that the work of Melito was directed mainly against
certain sectaries, perhaps Ebionites, who on the fourteenth
day of Nisan feasted after the manner of the
Jews upon a paschal lamb. This practice was so
distinctly Judaistic, that it was rejected everywhere
by the orthodox.</p>

<p>Of vastly more importance and significance, as
affecting the whole Church, were incidents which
occurred towards the close of the century. Victor,
bishop of Rome, successor next but one to Anicetus,
was a man of different temper; or, at all events, he
attached a much higher importance to uniformity
as to the time of observing Easter. Interest in the
question was roused in various quarters. Councils
of bishops (at the instance of Victor) discussed it
in Gaul, in Greece, in Palestine, in Pontus, and as
far east as Osrhoene beyond the Euphrates. By this
time it was found that what, for convenience, we
may style the Western practice was also largely
followed in the East. The churches, however, of
proconsular Asia still maintained their old position.
A letter written by Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus,
to Victor on their behalf is preserved by Eusebius<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.</p>

<p>Victor, departing from the moderate policy of
his predecessor Anicetus, thought the time had come
for dealing more drastically with his opponents on
the Paschal question, and sought to cut them off
from the communion of the Catholic Church<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Victor’s attitude called forth remonstrances from
various quarters, and was the occasion of a remarkable
letter written by Irenaeus, bishop of Lyons, in the
name of the brethren in Gaul, over whom he presided.
He declares that the mystery of the Lord’s Resurrection
should indeed be celebrated only on a Sunday,
yet he strongly urges the impropriety of Victor’s
cutting off ‘whole Churches of God’ because of
differences on such a matter. He then adds that
the controversy was not only on the question as to
the day on which Easter should be celebrated, but
also on the length and manner of the preceding fast,
varieties as to which he recounts (see p. 79); and
he goes on to remind Victor that bishops of Rome
in former times, while strictly preserving their own
usages, did not break the peace of the Church by
excommunications directed against those who followed
other ways<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>. Letters of similar purport were addressed
by Irenaeus to various other bishops. The result of
this intervention was that the Asiatic Churches were
for the time left undisturbed in the practice of their
traditional usages. How soon the Asiatic Churches
fell into line with the majority is not apparent. But
it seems evident that the change had taken place
before the Council of Nicaea.</p>

<p>We have seen that in the attempts to commemorate
on the proper days the death and resurrection
of the Lord, the Asiatics thought most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the <i>day of the month</i>, and the Westerns and those
who concurred with them thought most of the <i>day
of the week</i>. But the latter party had obviously to
make some attempt to lay down a rule which would
at least approximate the date of their Pascha to
the time of the year when the Lord suffered. The
vernal equinox was taken by them, and by the
Church of Alexandria, as the fixed point to which
the date of Easter should bear some settled relation.</p>

<p>It is perhaps impossible to determine with precision
when the rule came to be generally accepted
that the full moon, which was to regulate the date
of Easter, was the first full moon <i>after</i> the vernal
equinox. We find that this is the rule which
governs the Paschal Tables of Hippolytus (of which
more will be said hereafter), and we find it expressly
enjoined in that ancient collection of Church law
which goes under the name of the Apostolic Canons.
The Tables of Hippolytus can, with reasonable
certainty, be assigned to <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 222. In the Apostolic
Constitutions, the date of which it is impossible to
determine with any close approach to certainty<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>, the
rule runs, ‘Observe the days of the Pascha with all
care after the vernal equinox, that ye keep not the
memorial of the one passion twice in a year. Keep
it once only in a year for Him who died but once<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.’
The mystical reason assigned here also appears in
the letter of the Emperor Constantine, announcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the decision to which the Nicene Council came upon
the Paschal question<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>. Later on the reader will find
what is probably meant by keeping the Pascha twice
in the same year<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.</p>

<p>It would not perhaps be fitting to pass over in
silence the attempt made in the early part of the
third century by the Roman ecclesiastic, Hippolytus,
to construct a cycle which would make it possible
to predict the day on which Easter would fall in any
future year.</p>

<p>As to who this Hippolytus was, Eusebius and
subsequent students among the Fathers appear to
have known scarcely anything. Eusebius speaks of
the many writings of Hippolytus, and gives the titles
of some of them, and describes one more particularly.
This was a treatise <i>Concerning the Pascha</i>, in which
was to be found a certain sixteen-year rule (canon)
about the Pascha, the boundary of the writer’s computation
being the first year of the Emperor Alexander<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>,
<i>i.e.</i> Alexander Severus, whose first year was <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 222.</p>

<p>The brief statement of Eusebius, dull and prosaic
in itself, acquired suddenly a new and extraordinary
interest in the year 1551, when during some excavations
made in the neighbourhood of Rome, in the
Via Tiburtina (the road to Tivoli), a much shattered
statue was unearthed, which on being pieced together
exhibited, on the sides of the chair in which the figure
of a venerable looking man was represented as seated,
two elaborate numerical tables, in Greek characters,
one showing the day of the month on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Pascha, or fourteenth day of the moon, would fall
from <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 222 to <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 333: the other showing, for
the same number of years, the day of the month
upon which Easter ought to be kept. The statue,
as restored, may now be seen in the Museum of the
Vatican. The Tables are constructed in seven
columns of sixteen years each. On the back of the
chair were inscribed in Greek the titles of various
books, many of which corresponded with the titles of
works attributed to Hippolytus by Eusebius. There
could be no reasonable doubt that the statue was the
statue of Hippolytus, and that the Tables represented
his calculations as to the time for keeping Easter.</p>

<p>A further confirmation of the correctness of this
inference (though confirmation was indeed scarcely
needed) emerged when a Syriac version of the Cycle
of Hippolytus was discovered in a chronological
treatise by Elias of Nisibis<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>. It corresponds exactly
with the Tables inscribed on the chair.</p>

<p>An examination of the Tables of Hippolytus
reveals that he assumed ‘that after eight years
the full moons returned to the same day of the
solar month; and he took notice that after sixteen
years the days of the week moved one backward;
that is to say, the full moon in the first year of
the cycle being Saturday, April 13, after sixteen
years it would be Friday, April 13, and so on<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.’ But
for the purposes of what he supposed would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
perpetual Kalendar, Hippolytus desired to ascertain
after what interval the full moon would fall not only
on the same day of the solar month, but on the same
day of the week. He assumed that this would happen
after seven cycles of sixteen years.</p>

<p>We can also infer that Hippolytus probably
placed the vernal equinox on March 18, for every
full moon entered in his Tables is placed either
on (as in the case of <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 235) or after that date.</p>

<p>Again, the examination of his Tables reveals
what may seem to us the somewhat arbitrary regulation
that if the full moon fell upon Saturday the
Feast of the Resurrection should not be kept on
the following day, but on Sunday a week later.
The explanation probably is that it was considered
that Easter should never be held earlier than the
sixteenth day of the moon, that is, two days after
the day of the Crucifixion. If the full moon fell
upon Friday, then the following Sunday would be
Easter; but if the full moon fell upon Saturday, the
day of the Crucifixion was taken to be the following
Friday, and Easter would be two days after.</p>

<p>No Easter cycle yet devised is free from errors,
which have to be met by adjustments; but the Cycle
of Hippolytus was such that the errors accumulated
rapidly. It was more than two days wrong at the
end of the first sixteen years; and five days wrong
at the end of the second cycle; at the end of the
third cycle it would be nine days wrong<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>. This must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
have been soon discovered; and the cycle had to
be discarded. It is the earliest Easter cycle known
to us.</p>

<p>A cycle on the same lines as that of Hippolytus,
which has been (probably incorrectly) attributed to
St Cyprian, will be found in Fell’s edition of Cyprian
(1682), among the works commonly assigned to that
writer. By whomsoever it was composed it is ushered
in with a great flourish of trumpets, and the author
feels sure that he has been led by nothing short of
divine inspiration to the discovery. These Tables
can be assigned to <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 243. One cannot but suspect
that the author had got hold of the Hippolytean
Tables before their worthlessness was discovered.</p>

<p>Such seem to have been the best efforts of the
learning of Western Christendom in the third century
to deal with the Paschal problem. Nor at this
period was the Church of Alexandria, which at a
later date became the paramount authority on such
questions, any better equipped. Dionysius, about
the middle of the third century, justly styled by
Eusebius ‘the great bishop of Alexandria,’ made use
of the eight-year cycle, which, like its variant, the
sixteen-year cycle, gathered error rapidly.</p>

<p>It was, however, another distinguished Alexandrian,
more than a quarter of a century later, who
was the first, so far as we know, to make use of
the old nineteen-year cycle for the determination of
Easter. This was Anatolius, a native of Alexandria,
and eminent for learning of various kinds (among
which arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy are particularised),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
who became bishop of Laodicea in Syria
Prima in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 270. The nineteen-year cycle, with
some modifications, eventually, though slowly, displaced
all rivals<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>.</p>

<h3>II. <i>The Council of Nicaea and the Easter
Controversy.</i></h3>

<p>We may pass on now to the consideration of the
determinations on this question arrived at by the
Council of Nicaea.</p>

<p>The varieties of usage as to the dates of keeping
the Pascha had disturbed the mind of Constantine
before he issued his invitations to the bishops of the
empire to attend the Council. His trusted adviser,
Hosius, bishop of Corduba, had been sent by him
to the East in the hopes that by his arguments
and persuasion the followers of the Eastern practice
might be induced to yield. But the mission was
ineffective, and the matter was submitted to the
great Council in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 325. We have no record of
any of the proceedings connected with the matter
beyond what is to be found in a Synodical Letter
of the Council, and a circular letter of the Emperor.
We cannot help feeling some surprise that the Council
did not enact any canon on the subject; but it
was probably believed that the adoption of a rigid
canon, with an attendant anathema, might have
produced a formal schism, while a statement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
opinion of the Council could scarcely fail to be highly
influential in eventually securing uniformity. The
letter of the Council, preserved by Socrates<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>, is addressed
to the Church of Alexandria and the brethren
in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis. It simply announces
‘the good news’ that, in accordance with the desire
of those to whom the letter was addressed, the question
had been elucidated by the Council, and that all
the brethren of the East, who had formerly celebrated
the Pascha ‘with the Jews,’ will henceforth keep it
‘at the same time as the Romans, and ourselves, and
all those who from ancient times celebrated the day
at the same time with us<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Emperor is more full. He says that it was
thought by all that it would be fitting that the
Pascha should be kept on one day by all; that it
was declared to be particularly unworthy to follow
the custom of the Jews who had soiled their hands
with the most dreadful of crimes, and who are blinded
with error, so that they even frequently celebrate two
Paschas in one year. ‘Our Saviour has left us only
one festal day of our deliverance, that is to say, of
his holy passion; and he has willed that his Catholic
Church should be one.’ How unseemly is it that
some should be fasting while others are seated at the
banquet! He hopes that every one will agree in this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
It had been resolved that the Pascha should be kept
everywhere on one and the same day<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.</p>

<p>There is nothing in these letters to show what
rule had been established. All that is laid down
is that the Pascha should be kept everywhere on
the same day; and it assumed that the Roman and
Alexandrian rules as to Easter were identical, and
were well known. As a matter of fact, while the
Churches of Rome and Alexandria were at one both
in keeping Easter on a Sunday, and on a Sunday
after the vernal equinox, they were not agreed in
their methods of calculating the Sunday upon which
Easter would fall. Hence, long after the Council
of Nicaea, several instances occur in which a day
was taken for the Easter festival at Rome which
differed from the day which the Alexandrian experts
had calculated to be the correct day.</p>

<p>It is worthy of observation that the Emperor in
his letter reprobates what he assumes was the Jewish
practice of frequently celebrating two Paschas in the
same year. What is probably meant is that the
Jews at that time (whatever their earlier practice
may have been) did not think it necessary to keep
the Passover <i>after</i> the vernal equinox. Now the
vernal equinox was taken as the beginning of the
tropical or solar year; and it might happen from
time to time that the full moon of Nisan fell in
one year after the vernal equinox, and in the following
civil year before the equinox, which would give
two passovers in the same solar year. If this interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the words of Constantine’s letter be
correct, it would imply that the Christian Pascha
should always be celebrated after the equinox, which
was certainly already the general practice. But no
specific rule with reference to the equinox is laid
down in express terms either by the Fathers of the
Council or by the Emperor.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the Letter of Constantine
he states that the Lord has left us ‘only
one festal day of our deliverance, that is to say, of
his holy passion.’ The dominant thought connected
with the word Pascha was still that of the Crucifixion.
At a later period writers, for the sake of accuracy,
made the distinction between the ‘Pascha of the
Crucifixion’ (πάσχα σταυρώσιμον) and the ‘Pascha
of the Resurrection’ (πάσχα ἀναστάσιμον); and
eventually the thought of the Crucifixion disappears
from the connotation of the word, which has
given the name for what we call Easter to the
French (<i>pâques</i>); the Italians (<i>pasqua</i>); and the
Spaniards (<i>pascua</i>)<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p>

<p>After the Council of Nicaea, although the Quartodeciman
practice lingered on among unorthodox
sectaries, the differences among Catholics were in
the main confined to such questions as, When was
the equinox? and What Tables should be used for
predicting the Sunday which should be observed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Easter Day? The Synod of Antioch in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 341
(can. 1) could now make bold to advance a step beyond
the Oecumenical Council, and enacted a canon
pronouncing excommunication against any who acted
contrary to the command of the great and holy
Synod assembled at Nicaea regarding the Pascha<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>.
In principle the Church was united; but there were
differences in the application of the principle. In
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 444, and eleven years later, in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 455, Pope
Leo the Great was in perplexity as to the day upon
which Easter should be kept. In <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 444 he wrote
to Cyril of Alexandria on the subject. The answer
he received was that the proper day was not March 26
(as the Latins would make it) but April 23. In
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 455 Leo was much moved by finding that the
Alexandrian computists had given April 24 for Easter
Day, while those at Rome had assigned the festival
to April 17, a week earlier. The matter seemed to
him of sufficient importance to justify his writing to
Marcianus, Emperor of the East, whom he now besought
to intervene, and direct the Alexandrians not
to name April 24, declaring that so late a date was
beyond the ancient Paschal limits. Leo also wrote
on the same subject to the learned and once beautiful
Eudocia Augusta, who, though now spending her old
age in retirement and devotion at Jerusalem, was not
without influence in church affairs. The Emperor
had enquiries made among certain bishops of the
East and communicated with the Alexandrians. The
result was that the observance of April 24 was reaffirmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and the bishop of Rome reluctantly submitted
for the sake of peace<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>.</p>

<p>The account of the matter lies in the fact that
while the Alexandrians had long before adopted the
Paschal limits that still continue to rule our Easter,
that is, from March 22 to April 25, the Latins,
though at this date accepting the prior limit, hesitated
as to the later, because the Easter Tables then
in use among them had placed the later Paschal limit
on April 23.</p>

<p>The position of authority conceded to the Church
of Alexandria on the question as to the date of the
Pascha was due to the acknowledged learning and
skill of the astronomers and mathematicians of that
city in matters of chronology and the computation
of time. It was the practice of the bishop of Alexandria,
as early at least as the middle of the third
century, to issue what were styled ‘Festal Letters’
or, at a later date, ‘Paschal Letters,’ commonly of
the nature of a homily on the religious lessons of the
Paschal season, with an announcement as to the date
of the next Pascha. These letters were commonly
issued by the bishop a year in advance, and were
sent by special messengers to his comprovincial
bishops.</p>

<p>It has been supposed by several ecclesiastical
historians of repute that the Council of Nicaea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
expressly authorised the bishop of Alexandria to
issue these preparatory notices to the authorities in
the various churches of Christendom. The evidence
for this opinion is lacking; but certainly, as a matter
of fact, the judgment of Alexandria carried great
weight. In the West, however, the general practice
was that Metropolitans should determine the date,
and announce the day to their suffragans. In the
sixth century the Council of Orleans (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 541) directs
that if the Metropolitan were in doubt he should
consult the Apostolic see (Rome), and act in accordance
with its decision (can. 1). About one hundred
years later it would appear from the fifth canon of
the Council of Toledo (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 633) that the Spanish
Metropolitan bishops did not receive information as
to the date of Easter from any external source. They
are directed to enquire among themselves by letter
three months before the Epiphany, and make the
announcement; and the reason assigned for this
canon is that erroneous Easter Tables had caused
differences.</p>

<p>To attempt anything like a detailed account of
the varieties in the methods adopted for the determination
of Easter which held their ground for a
time, some in the East, some in the West, would
be unsuitable in an introductory work like the present.
The extraordinary persistence exhibited by
the Celtic Churches of Britain and Ireland in maintaining
for a long time their own method of computing
Easter against the Roman method introduced
by Augustine of Canterbury and his followers, is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
important and interesting feature in the history of
Christianity in these countries. It is enough here
to say that the native Churches were not Quartodecimans
(as has sometimes been incorrectly alleged),
but were adhering to a cycle which they had received
long before the Roman missionaries arrived in Britain<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.
We must here be content with briefly noticing some
of the leading features in the history of the change
which gradually led up to the adoption of the
Nineteen-Year Cycle as modified and propounded by
Dionysius Exiguus in the early part of the sixth
century.</p>

<p>After the abandonment of the Cycle of Hippolytus
there is found in use at Rome an 84-year cycle. In
this the date of Easter is believed to have oscillated
between March 25 and April 21; and between the
fourteenth and twentieth day of the moon. This
system, according to the results of recent research,
was modified in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 312 and again in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 343.
This cycle (still of 84 years) came to be known as
the <i>supputatio Romana</i>. Easter could not now fall
earlier than the sixteenth, nor later than the twenty-second
of the moon, while its date limits were March
22 and April 21. This <i>supputatio</i>, with some modifications,
served the bishops of Rome during the
fourth and the greater part of the fifth century. The
Alexandrians, on the other hand, had about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 277
come to use the more exact Nineteen-Year cycle,
with possible Easters between March 22 and April 25,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and between the fifteenth and twenty-second of the
moon<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.</p>

<p>In the pontificate of Leo the Great the differences
which he had with the Church of Alexandria as to
the date of Easter caused him to direct his archdeacon,
Hilary (who afterwards succeeded to the
papal throne), to investigate the whole question.
Hilary resorted to the aid of Victorius of Aquitaine,
who happened to be then at Rome. Victorius devised,
or adopted, a cycle of 532 years, a combination
of the lunar cycle of 19 years with the so-called
solar cycle of 28 years (19 × 28 = 532). His Easter
limits were March 22 and April 24.</p>

<p>The cycle of Victorius met with favourable acceptance,
more particularly in Gaul, where it continued
in use till nearly the end of the eighth century.</p>

<p>At Rome, whatever may have been the position
actually attained by the cycle of Victorius, it and
all other devices for determining Easter gave way
in the sixth century (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 527) before the Paschal
Tables of Dionysius Exiguus. This remarkable person,
who came to occupy an eminent place in the
science of chronology generally, as well as in the
computations necessary for ecclesiastical purposes,
was a monk, a Scythian by birth, who settled in a
monastery at Rome. It is to him that we owe in
chronology the adoption by Western Christendom
of what we know as the ‘Christian Era’ and ‘the
year of our Lord,’ now in universal use for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
dating of the events of history, and of all our documents
public and private.</p>

<p>The system of Dionysius was, practically, the
adoption of the Nineteen-Year Cycle of the Alexandrians.
It fixed the date of the vernal equinox
at March 21, placed the Paschal limits at March 22
and April 25, and declared Easter to be the next
Sunday after the Paschal full moon. We have here
in full the rule which eventually came to prevail
everywhere. But its adoption was not immediate
in all countries<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.</p>

<p>The space at our disposal will not allow of our
treating in detail of the work of the computists, and
of the ‘Sunday Letters,’ ‘Epacts,’ and other technical
terms which appear in the old Church Kalendars.
For these, as well as for such terms as ‘Indiction,’
‘Lunar Regulars,’ ‘Solar Regulars,’ and ‘Concurrents,’
reference may be made to such books as Sir
Harris Nicholas’ <i>Chronology of History</i>, and Giry’s
fuller and lucid <i>Manuel de Diplomatique</i>.</p>

<h3><i>The Gregorian Reform.</i></h3>

<p>The defects of the Nineteen-Year Cycle became
apparent after some lapse of time. There were two
grave sources of error. First, the Kalendar proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
on the assumption that the solar year consisted of
365¼ days; but the true solar year is 11 minutes
and some seconds shorter than the Kalendar year,
and the accumulation of this error gradually brought
confusion into the system. In one hundred and
thirty years the Kalendar will have gained on the
true solar year by almost exactly one day. At the
date of the Council of Nicaea (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 325) the vernal
equinox was placed at March 21, but in the year
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 450 the true vernal equinox would be on March
20. In <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 585 the equinox would be on March 19;
in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 715 on March 18, and so on. And thus it
will be seen that in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1582, when the Kalendar
was reformed, the real vernal equinox was about ten
days earlier than the March 21 of the Kalendar.</p>

<p>The second source of error lay in the assumption
that at the close of a cycle of nineteen years there was
an exact agreement of solar and lunar time. Nineteen
solar years, of 365¼ days, make 6939 days and
18 hours; but 235 moons of 29 days, 12 hours,
44 minutes, and 3 seconds and a fraction make 6939
days, 16 hours, and a fraction over 31 minutes. So it
comes about that the solar time in nineteen years is
nearly 1½ hours in excess of the real lunar time. In
other words, the moons in the second cycle of nineteen
years make their changes nearly 1½ hours earlier
than they did in the first cycle. It is easy then
to show that in about 308 years this difference would
amount to a whole day; and in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1582, when the
Gregorian reform was effected, the moon in the
heavens made its changes nearly four days before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the time which was indicated for these changes in
the Kalendar.</p>

<p>We must omit any notice of the various schemes
for reforming the Kalendar prior to the reformation
of Gregory XIII. After he had consented to the
general idea that a reformation should be undertaken,
various schemes were proposed. Of these,
that of Luigi Lilio, a physician and astronomer of
the city of Rome, obtained the preference<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>. And it
is on the lines suggested by Lilio that the work was
accomplished, mainly by a German mathematician
then resident at Rome, the Jesuit, Christopher
Schlüssel (or, in the Latin form of his name, Clavius),
who afterwards published at Rome, in folio,
an exposition of the work done, under the title
<i>Romani Calendarii a Gregorio XIII Pontifice
Maximo restituti Explicatio</i> (1603).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Leading Features of the Gregorian Reform</span></h4>

<p>The Gregorian Reform is an ingenious and, indeed,
brilliant practical solution of the problems presented
by the condition of the Kalendar at the close of the
sixteenth century. The characteristic features of the
Gregorian system will now be described.</p>

<p>1. It was known that the true vernal equinox
was at this date (1582) about ten days earlier than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
March 21 as marked in the Kalendar. Should the
equinox be fixed as at March 11? It was resolved
to keep the equinox at the nominal date of March
21, and to bring the date into conformity with facts
by the simple process of striking out ten nominal
days. It was decreed that the day following Oct. 4,
1582 (when what is known as the New Style was to
make its beginning), should be counted, not as Oct. 5,
but as Oct. 15. And thus in the following year, 1583,
the true vernal equinox would fall on March 21, as
it was supposed to have fallen in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 325, the date
of the Council of Nicaea.</p>

<p>2. But how was it to be provided that in the
future the same errors which had vitiated the old
Kalendar should not come in time to vitiate the new?</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the time of the old
Kalendar had gained on true solar time at the rate,
almost precisely, of one day in every 130 years. If
the counting of one day could be suppressed in every
130 years, the end would be obtained. For purposes
of practical convenience the reformers of the Kalendar
assumed that 133 years should be taken as the period
in which the Kalendar time exceeded the solar time
by one day. The difference, for the purpose in hand,
was insignificant; and, as will be seen hereafter, this
deliberately chosen error will not affect the Kalendar
to the extent of one day till <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 5200, while it makes
calculations much simpler.</p>

<p>Now the plan adopted to prevent the accumulation
of the error in the old Kalendar was as follows:
if one day could be withdrawn in every 133 years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
or, what is the same thing, three days in every 399
years, the object would be attained.</p>

<p>In the Old Style, every year of an exact century—every
centurial (or, as it was sometimes called,
secular) year—was a leap-year of 366 days. What
would be the effect of treating every centurial year
as a common year of 365 days? We should have
suppressed four days at the end of four centuries
when we ought to suppress only three in 399 years.
So it was suggested that while three successive
centurial years should be regarded as common years,
the fourth centurial year should be treated as a leap-year.
Thus, in both Old and New Style the years
1600 and 2000 are leap-years; but 1700, 1800, and
1900, which in the Old Style were leap-years, are in
the New Style treated as common years of 365 days.
And the rule laid down in the Gregorian system was
that if the number expressed by the first two figures
of the century was exactly divisible by 4 it should
be a leap-year, but if not exactly divisible by 4 it
should be treated as a common year. The numbers
16 and 20 are exactly divisible by 4, but 17, 18, and
19 are not so divisible. The years 1600 and 2000
are in the New Style leap-years, but the years 1700,
1800, and 1900 are in the New Style common years.</p>

<p>It is true that the adoption of 133 years, instead
of 130 years, as the time in which in the Old Style one
day was gained by the Kalendar on the sun, imports
an error into the system, which causes the Kalendar
to fall behind the sun. This error, as has been said,
will accumulate to the extent of one day in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 5200.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
It may be thought that, if men be on the earth at
that date, they will know how to deal with the case.
Yet it is suggested for the instruction of our remote
posterity that they will have only to make <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 5200
a common year, instead of a leap-year, to bring things
back to correctness<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.</p>

<p>For the Sunday letters in the New Style and for
the Cycle of Epacts in the Gregorian Kalendar, see
Dr Seabury, <i>Theory and Use of the Church Calendar</i>.</p>

<p>The work of the Gregorian reformation is marvellous
in its elaborate ingenuity. It even provides
for a case which will not occur till Dec. 31, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 8600.
Yet it does not reach the attainment of an exact
correspondence with astronomical phenomena. And
it has been frequently observed that the new moons
of the Kalendar may occur one, two, or even three
days <i>later</i> than the new moons of the astronomer.
In fact the astronomical new moon rarely occurs on
the date marked for the ecclesiastical new moon.
But care has been taken that the new moon of the
Kalendar never occurs <i>earlier</i> than the new moon
of astronomy.</p>

<h3><i>The adoption of the New Style.</i></h3>

<p>As was to be expected, the countries of Europe
which recognised the authority of the bishop of
Rome were not long in accepting the reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of the Kalendar. Spain, Portugal, and part of
Italy made the change on the same day as at
Rome, that is on Oct. 15 (5), 1582. In France
and Lorraine the change was made on December
20 (10) in the same year; in the Roman Catholic
cantons of Switzerland in 1583 or 1584; in Poland
in 1586; in Hungary in 1587. In Protestant
countries and countries where Protestants were
numerous the alteration was more slowly effected.
But Denmark was an exception, for the New Style
was adopted in 1582. In Holland and the Low
Countries the provinces were divided in their
acceptance of the New Style, and in some places
the change was not effected till the year 1700. In
Germany we also find a variety of usages: Austria
and Roman Catholics in other parts accepted the
change in 1584, but Protestants did not yield till
1700, when they adopted the Kalendar of the German
astronomer, Erhard Weigel, which differed from the
Gregorian Kalendar only in the rule for determining
Easter. This variation brought about the result
that the Protestants and Roman Catholics sometimes
celebrated Easter on different days. In 1778
Frederick the Great ordained that from that time
Easter should be kept at the time ascertained from
the Gregorian Paschal moon. Weigel’s Kalendar was
also adopted in the Protestant cantons of Switzerland
in 1700. In Russia, Greece, and throughout the
Christian East the Old Kalendar is still in use<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Great Britain was the last of the countries of
Western Europe to adopt the New Style. It is true
that as early as March 16, 1584-5, a bill was
introduced in the House of Lords under the title,
‘An Act giving her Majesty [Queen Elizabeth]
authority to alter and new make a Calendar according
to the Calendar used in other countries.’ The
bill was read a second time in the House of Lords,
and proceeded no further.</p>

<p>Through an extraordinary blunder, it has been
stated by writers of repute that Scotland adopted
the New Style in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1600. The error originated
in the fact that King James VI, with the advice
of the Lords of his Privy Council, ordered by proclamation
dated Haliruidhous, Dec. 17, 1599, that
on and after Jan. 1, 1600, the year should be held
to begin on Jan. 1 instead of March 25: but there
was no rectification of the Kalendar by the omission
of nominal days. In England the legal year
continued to begin on March 25 till 1752. The
accession of James VI to the throne of England on
the death of Elizabeth occurred on March 24, 1602,
according to the English style, but on March 24,
1603, according to the Scottish style. In this and
such like cases the double dates may be wisely
employed, thus, March 24, 1602-3. But Scotland
did not use the New Style till it was adopted in
1752, in accordance with the provision of the Act
of Parliament of Great Britain (24 George II, c. 23),
entitled ‘An Act for regulating the commencement of
the Year, and for correcting the Calendar now in use.’</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">THE KALENDAR OF THE ORTHODOX CHURCH
OF THE EAST</span></h2>

<p>The modern Kalendar of the Byzantine Church
is here dealt with. The early Menologies (which
corresponded pretty closely to the Martyrologies of
the West) show the usual phenomena of comparative
simplicity passing into forms of great elaboration.
The best known are the Menology of Constantinople
of the eighth century and that which is known as
the <i>Basilianum</i>, now most commonly associated with
the Emperor Basil II (<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 976-1025), at whose
instance it is said to have been composed<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.</p>

<p>The history of the growth and variations of the
Kalendar of the Greeks cannot be here attempted;
we confine ourselves to the Kalendar now in use.</p>

<h3>I. <i>Immoveable commemorations.</i></h3>

<p>This Kalendar, or the Kalendar of Saints, begins
on Sept. 1, the first day of the year of the Indiction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
With us in the West the civil year has left no mark
upon the services of the Church. In the Greek
Church in the hymns the divine blessing is invoked
on the new year; and two of the lessons at Vespers
are chosen as bearing references applicable to the
day.</p>

<p>The services of the Church have frequently several
commemorations of various saints upon the same
day; and this general statement may be illustrated
from Sept. 1. In addition to the <i>propria</i> of the new
year, we find commemorations of Simeon Stylites
senior; his mother, St Martha; forty women martyrs
with the Deacon Ammun; and a miraculous
<i>icon</i> of St Mary. To these must be added a commemoration
of the Old Testament worthy, Joshua,
the son of Nun. This specimen will suffice to show
that it would be impossible in the space at our
disposal to exhibit the commemorations of every day
in the year<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. We shall confine ourselves to exhibiting
the Greek classification of festivals, and marking
the dates of some of the more eminent commemorations.
But it must be observed that days that are
not regarded as festivals frequently contain canons
(metrical hymns) which commemorate saints or
martyrs. Indeed the offices of the Eastern service-books
are packed with an extraordinary abundance
of hagiological reference and allusion.</p>

<p>As regards dignity and importance in the Greek
Church, in addition to Easter, which stands pre-eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and is known by way of distinction as ‘the
Feast’ (ἡ ἑορτή), there are twelve festivals of the first
rank, some of them being moveable. These are: (1) the
Nativity of the Lord, Dec. 25; (2) the Theophany
(Epiphany), Jan. 6; (3) Hypapante (Purification),
Feb. 2; (4) the Annunciation of the Theotokos,
March 25; (5) the festival of Palms, which with the
Sabbath of Lazarus on the preceding day makes one
festival; (6) the Ascension of the Lord; (7) Pentecost;
(8) the Transfiguration, Aug. 6; (9) the Repose
of Theotokos, Aug. 15; (10) the Nativity of Theotokos,
Sept. 8; (11) the Exaltation of the Cross,
Sept. 14; (12) the Entrance of the Theotokos into
the Temple (<i>i.e.</i> her presentation), Nov. 21.</p>

<p>Each of these is marked first by the day preceding
(<i>proheortia</i>) partaking of a <i>festive</i> character,
and secondly, by having an echo of the festival on
certain following days, which are known as the
<i>apodosis</i> of the feast; but the name is often applied
to the final day of the observance. The apodosis,
unlike the Western Octave, is in some cases shorter
than a week and in some cases longer. Thus, the
apodosis of the Nativity of the Virgin (Sept. 8)
terminates on Sept. 12; while the apodosis of the
Theophany (Jan. 6) ordinarily extends to Jan. 14.</p>

<p>Next in dignity are four festivals of high rank,
though not having either <i>proheortia</i> or <i>apodosis</i>.
They are: (1) the Circumcision, Jan. 1; (2) the
Nativity of the Forerunner (St John Baptist), June
24; (3) St Peter and St Paul, the Koryphaeoi, June
29; (4) the Decollation of the Forerunner, Aug. 29.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The twelve of the first group and the four of the
second may be taken as together corresponding in
a measure to festivals of the first class in the Roman
classification.</p>

<p>Similarly corresponding to feasts of the second
class in the West is a group which is divided into
greater and lesser. The greater feasts of this group
are marked liturgically by the singing of a canon of
the Virgin in addition to the canon proper to the
feast. The lesser are marked by the singing in the
service of what is known as <i>Polyeleos</i>, a name given
to Psalms cxxxiv, cxxxv (Pss. cxxxv, cxxxvi in the
enumeration of the English Prayer Book).</p>

<p>The greater feasts of the middle class are: (1)
the common festival of the three Doctors of the
Church [Chrysostom, Basil, Gregory Nazianzen],
Jan. 30; (2) St George, martyr, April 23; (3) St
John the Evangelist, May 8; (4) the Translation
of the image of Christ, made without hands, from
Edessa, Aug. 16; (5) the Migration of St John
the Evangelist, Sept. 26. This festival is based on
the ancient legend that St John did not die, but was
translated; (6) St Sabbas, the Sanctified [Abbot of
Palestine, who died <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 531], Dec. 5; (7) St Nicholas
of Myra, the wonder-worker, Dec. 6.</p>

<p>The lesser feasts of the middle class include:
(1) St Anthony, hermit, Jan. 17; (2) the forty
Martyrs [of Sebaste, under Licinius], March 9;
(3) St Constantine and St Helena, May 21; (4) St
Cosmas and St Damian, the unmercenary physicians,
July 1; (5) St Elias, the prophet, July 20; (6) St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Demetrius, Great Martyr [of Thessalonica, under
Diocletian], Oct. 26; (7) Synaxis of the Archangel,
St Michael, Nov. 8; (8) St Andrew the Apostle,
Nov. 30.</p>

<p>There is a third class subdivided into (<i>a</i>) festivals
with the great doxology, and (<i>b</i>) festivals without
the great doxology<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. Festivals of the third class
are very numerous, but they are festivals rather of
the service-books than of actual life, upon which
they leave little or no impression. The number of
festivals kept by the Greeks and observed either by
a complete or a partial cessation from trade and
servile labour far surpasses the festivals so observed
in any of the countries of Western Christendom.</p>

<p>The Russian Kalendar corresponds largely to the
Byzantine; but there are, as might be expected, not
a few commemorations of persons, events, and of
miraculous <i>icons</i>, peculiar to Russia.</p>

<p>A few explanatory observations may here be
added: (1) The Eastern Kalendars contrast in a
striking way with the Western in the prominence
given to commemorations of the saints and heroes
of the Old Testament. All the prophets and many
of the righteous men of Hebrew history have their
days. And the service-books contain a <i>common</i> of
Prophets as well as a <i>common</i> of Apostles, etc.</p>

<p>(2) Honorary epithets are freely bestowed upon
the various saints without any very precise significance.
Thus ‘God-bearing’ (<i>theophorus</i>), which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a natural epithet in the case of Ignatius, as being
used of himself in his writings, is bestowed on various
distinguished ascetics, as Anthony, Euthymius, Sabbas,
Onuphrius.</p>

<p>(3) The ground for the distinction between
‘Martyrs’ and ‘Great Martyrs’ is not apparent.
‘Hieromartyrs’ are martyrs who were bishops or
priests; ‘Hosiomartyrs’ are martyrs who were living
as religious. Thekla, as well as Stephen, is ‘Protomartyr.’</p>

<p>(4) The word ‘Apostle’ is not confined to the
twelve. The seventy disciples whom the Lord sent
forth are the ‘Seventy Apostles,’ among whom were
reckoned many of the persons named in the salutations
of St Paul’s Epistles. And the word is also
applied to certain companions or acquaintances of
St Paul, as <i>e.g.</i> Ananias of Damascus, Agabus, Titus,
etc. ‘Equal to the Apostles’ (<i>Isapostolos</i>) is applied
(<i>a</i>) to very early saints, <i>e.g.</i> Abercius of Hierapolis,
Mary Magdalene, Junia, Thekla, etc.; and (<i>b</i>) to
great princes who were distinguished for their services
to the Church, as Constantine and Helena.</p>

<p>‘Wonder-worker’ (<i>thaumaturgos</i>) is used of
various saints famous for their miracles, as <i>e.g.</i>
Charilampes (Feb. 10), Spiridion (Dec. 12), Gregory,
bishop of Neocaesarea in Pontus (Nov. 17), the
Saint Elizabeth (April 24), of uncertain date, who
never washed her body with water, and others.</p>

<p>John, son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, who with
us is the Baptist, appears as the Precursor or Forerunner
(<i>Prodromos</i>). He figures much in the services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
of the Church: and several days are dedicated to
his honour; his Conception (Sept. 23), his Nativity
(June 24), his Decollation (Aug. 29) and the great
feast known as his Synaxis (Jan. 7). In addition,
the first and second finding of his head is commemorated
on Feb. 24, and the third finding of his
head on May 25.</p>

<p>St Mary the Virgin is almost invariably the
Theotokos, and Joachim and Anna are the Theopator
and Theometor (Sept. 9).</p>

<p>The ‘unmercenary’ (<i>anarguroi</i>) saints are generally
physicians who took no fees, as Cosmas and
Damian, Cyrus and his companion John, and Pantaleon.</p>

<p>The term <i>Synaxis</i> in such phrases as the Synaxis
of the Archangel Michael (Nov. 8), the Synaxis of
the Theotokos (Dec. 26), the Synaxis of the seventy
Apostles (Jan. 4), the Synaxis of the Forerunner (Jan.
7), the Synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel (March
26), the Synaxis of the twelve Apostles (June 30),
is not easily rendered into English; and its precise
significance (as used in the Kalendar) is not obvious.
It is sometimes used for a gathering or assembly of
people; but more commonly it is employed to signify
a Eucharistic Communion<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p>

<p>It is customary after the great feasts of our Lord
and of the Virgin Mary to subjoin on the following
day the commemoration of saints associated with the
event commemorated on the preceding day. Thus,
the Epiphany (Theophany) in the Greek Church being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
chiefly concerned with the Baptism of Christ, we
have on the following day (Jan. 7) the feast of
St John Baptist; after the Hypapante, or meeting
with Simeon and Anna in the Temple (on Feb. 2,
the day of the Purification of the Virgin, in the West),
we find (Feb. 3) Simeon and Anna the prophetess;
after the Nativity of the Lord, the synaxis of the
Theotokos, Dec. 26; after the Nativity of the Virgin
(Sept. 8) we have on Sept. 9 Joachim and Anna, her
parents; after the Annunciation (March 25) we have
on March 26 the synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel,
who made the great announcement.</p>

<p>It remains to be added that, as in the Orthodox
Church of the East Wednesdays and Fridays are
observed as strict fasts alike by the clergy, the
monks, and the laity, most of the important festivals
carry with them either a partial dispensation (as in
some cases for the use of oil and wine, and in others
for the use of oil, wine, and fish) or a dispensation
for all kinds of food, when a festival falls on one
of these fast days.</p>

<p>We now proceed to describe the annual cycle
of Sundays.</p>

<h3>II. <i>The Dominical Kalendar of the Orthodox
Church of the East.</i></h3>

<p>The arrangement of the Sundays falls into two
divisions, the first beginning with the Sunday before
our Western Septuagesima; and the second, immediately
after our Trinity Sunday, which, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Greeks, is called the Sunday of All Saints. In the
following table, opposite the names of the Sundays
for the earlier part of the Dominical cycle, as given
in the Greek service-books, are placed the names of
the corresponding Sundays in the West, as known to
English churchmen.</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>The following Sundays are numbered the Second,
Third, Fourth after Pentecost, and so on, till we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
reach the Sunday of the Publican (the Sunday
before Septuagesima) in the following year. But
while the numbers are continuous, special names are
given to certain Sundays. Thus we find the Sunday
before and the Sunday after the Exaltation of the
Cross (Sept. 14); the Sundays before and after the
Nativity; the Sundays before and after the Lights
(<i>i.e.</i> the Epiphany).</p>

<p>Again, we sometimes find the Sundays after
Pentecost referred to as the First, Second, Third,
etc., of Matthew; because the liturgical Gospel on
these Sundays, on to the Exaltation of the Cross,
is taken from St Matthew. Similarly, after the
Exaltation of the Cross and on to Apocreos the
liturgical Gospel for the Sundays is taken from St
Luke, and the Sundays are named First, Second,
Third, etc., of Luke.</p>

<p>It is the subject-matter of the Gospel for the day
which gives its name to the Sundays called the
Publican, the Prodigal, St Thomas, the Myrrh-bearers
(<i>i.e.</i> the women bringing spices to the tomb), etc.</p>

<p>On the Sunday of Orthodoxy (the first in Lent)
some sixty anathemas against heresy of various kinds
are recited, including several against the Iconoclasts
who were condemned at the second Council of Nicaea
(<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 787). Tyrinis (or Tyrophagus) and Apocreos
are explained elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.</p>

<p>The name ‘Antipasch,’ for the first Sunday after
Easter (Low Sunday; <i>Dominica in Albis</i>), implies
that it is ‘over against’ or ‘answering to’ the Pasch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
On the Sunday of the Three hundred and eighteen
holy Fathers of Nicaea a canon (or metrical hymn)
in honour of the Council is sung.</p>

<p>The naming of the week in relation to the Sunday
is peculiar, and does not follow, as in the West, a
consistent rule. In some cases, the week <i>preceding</i>
a Sunday is given its name: in other cases the week
is called after the Sunday with which it begins. And
when the determination of dates is in view the student
should be on the alert. Thus, the week of
Apocreos (the last week of flesh-eating) precedes the
Sunday Apocreos; the week of Tyrine (when cheese,
butter and milk are allowed) precedes the Sunday
of that name; and the first week of the Lenten fast
precedes the Sunday that is the first in Lent. On
the other hand, after Antipascha and on to the
second Sunday after Pentecost the weeks are named
from the Sunday which they follow: while the
naming the week from the Sunday which follows
is resumed at the latter date<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.</p>

<p>The period from the Sunday of the Publican to
Easter Eve inclusive is sometimes called the time
of the Triodion (Τριῴδιον), because the <i>propria</i> for
that time are contained in a service-book which bears
that name; while the period from Easter Day to the
Sunday of All Saints (first Sunday after Pentecost),
both inclusive, is called the time of the Pentekostarion
(Πεντηκοστάριον) from the name of the service-book
used at that time.</p>

<p>A few words must be said on certain week-days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
observed with special dignity, the position of which
in the almanack varies with the position of Sundays
as affected by the incidence of Easter. It will be
remembered that in the East the Sabbath (Saturday)
is reckoned as a day of special religious observance;
and some Sabbaths are distinguished by special
names. The Sabbath of Apocreos is a day for the
solemn commemoration of all the faithful departed;
and vigils are kept during the night. It is known
as the Sabbath of the Dead. The next following
Sabbath serves for the commemoration of religious
and ascetics; it is named the Sabbath of Ascetics.
On the Sabbath of the first week of Lent (known
as the Sabbath of Kollyba) there is a commemoration
of St Theodore Tyro, martyr, who, according to the
legend, in the time of Julian the apostate, appeared
to the bishop of Constantinople, and ordered him
in a great emergency to make <i>Kollyba</i> and distribute
them to the people. The bishop said in reply that
he did not know what <i>Kollyba</i> were, and the saint
explained that they were wheaten cakes. We need
not pursue the story further. The Sabbath before
the fifth Sunday in Lent is the Sabbath of the
Akathist. A hymn, so called, in honour of the
Virgin, was sung throughout the night by the people,
<i>not sitting down</i>. The Sabbath before the Sixth
Sunday commemorates the raising of Lazarus, and
is called the Sabbath of Lazarus. Easter Eve is
the ‘Great Sabbath.’</p>

<p>It may be observed that while in the West the
word <i>Parasceve</i> is used exclusively for Good Friday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in the East the word is used for every Friday, and
Good Friday is distinguished by the epithet <i>Great</i>.</p>

<p>A detailed exhibition of the Byzantine Kalendar
cannot be attempted here, but the student will find
it treated by J. M. Neale in the <i>General Introduction</i>
to his <i>History of the Holy Eastern Church</i> (vol. <span class="smcapuc">II</span>.)
and with great fulness in Nilles’ <i>Kalendarium

<span class="smaller">THE PASCHAL QUESTION IN THE CELTIC
CHURCHES</span></h2>

<p>The controversies as to the calculation of Easter between
the Roman ecclesiastics, on the one hand, and, on
the other, the ecclesiastics of Ireland (Scotia), Scotland
(Alban), and Wales, arose from the fact that our native
Churches continued to follow a cycle which had, at the
beginning of the fourth century, prevailed at Rome, but
which was afterwards abandoned by the Church of that
city. An admirable account of the matter will be found
in Prof. Bury’s <i>Life of St Patrick</i>, 371-374. The improved
Roman computation was eventually adopted in
the south of Ireland about <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 650; in the north of
Ireland in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 703; among the Picts of Scotland in
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 710; at Iona in <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 716; and in South Wales in
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 802.</p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX_II">APPENDIX II<br />
<span class="smaller">NOTE ON THE KALENDARS OF THE
SEPARATED CHURCHES OF THE EAST</span></h2>

<p>I. The Armenians. The year is counted from the
year 551 of our era, when the Catholicos, Moses II, who
reformed the Kalendar, ascended the patriarchal throne.
Thus <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1910 is the year 1359 among the Armenians.</p>

<p>One noteworthy feature of the Armenian observance
is that, with the exception of the Nativity (Jan. 6), the
Circumcision, the Presentation of the Lord in the Temple,
and the Annunciation, various important festivals are
transferred to the following Sunday. Certain minor Holy
Days, if they fall on Wednesday, Friday, or Sunday, are
in some cases omitted, while others are transferred to the
following Saturday. In regard to days of fasting, in
addition to Lent, the most remarkable feature is ‘the
fast of Nineveh,’ kept for two weeks, one month before
the beginning of Lent. The days of the week following
Pentecost are fast days (see p. 91 f.). For details see E. F. K.
Fortescue’s <i>Armenian Church</i>, and Nilles, <i>op. cit.</i> (vol. <span class="smcapuc">II.</span>).</p>

<p>II. The Eastern Syrian (Chaldean, Assyrian, Nestorian)
Church. The Kalendar, Lectionary, and a list of
days of Martyrs and others for which no special lessons
are appointed will be found in Bishop A. J. Maclean’s
<i>East Syrian Daily Offices</i>. One of the most interesting
features is the frequency with which Friday is observed
as a commemoration of saints; and sometimes the Friday
commemoration is related in history or in thought with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the event commemorated on the preceding Sunday or
great festival. Thus St John Baptist is commemorated
on the Friday after the Epiphany (Jan. 6), of which festival
the baptism of the Lord is the dominant thought.
The festival is popularly called at Urmi ‘The New waters.’
For details see Maclean.</p>

<p>III. The Coptic (Egyptian) and Abyssinian Churches,
both Monophysite. The Copts compute their years according
to ‘the era of the martyrs’ (of Diocletian), commencing
<span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 284. The year begins on the first of the
month Tout, a day corresponding to Sept. 10. Each
month consists of 30 days; and the five (or in leap-year
six) days necessary to complete the solar year are called
‘the little month.’ There are fourteen principal feasts.
The most peculiar features are commemorations of the
Four-and-twenty Elders, and of the Four Beasts, of the
Revelation.</p>

<p>The Ethiopic Kalendar runs on broadly similar lines;
but it is a peculiar feature of this Kalendar that there are
monthly celebrations of the Lord’s Nativity (except that
the Lord’s Conception is substituted on March 25), as well
as of St Mary, of St Michael, and of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob. Pontius Pilate is commemorated on June 25. See
Neale’s <i>Eastern Church</i> (<span class="smcapuc">II.</span> 805-815).</p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX_III">APPENDIX III<br />
<span class="smaller">NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE KALENDAR
OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND SINCE THE
REFORMATION</span></h2>

<p>As early as 1532 we find a Petition of the Commons
(really emanating from the Court) to Henry VIII that,
with the advice of his most honourable council, prelates,
and ordinaries, holy days, ‘and specially such as fall in the
harvest,’ may be ‘made fewer in number.’ To this the
ordinaries answered, objecting to change, and, with reference
to holy days in harvest, stating that ‘there be in August
but St Lawrence, the Assumption of our Blessed Lady,
St Bartholomew, and in September the Nativity of our
Lady, the Exaltation of the Cross, and St Matthew the
Apostle, before which days harvest is commonly ended<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.’
The reference both in the Petition and the answer is
obviously to holy days carrying with them a cessation
of labour.</p>

<p>In 1536 Convocation passed an ordinance abrogating
superfluous holy days. It was ordained that in term time
no holy days should be kept except Ascension Day, the
Nativity of the Baptist, Allhallen, and Candlemas, nor
in harvest except feasts of the Apostles and our Lady.
St George was to continue to be celebrated. The feast
of the patron of each church was to be abolished; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
feast of every church’s dedication was to be observed on
the first Sunday in October. By this ordinance the great
festival of St Thomas Becket, the translation of his relics
(July 7), fell, as occurring in the season of harvest. Two
years later by a royal proclamation the festival of his
martyrdom (Dec. 29) met the same fate.</p>

<p>The Kalendar of the First Prayer Book of Edward VI
(1549) exhibits a clean sweep of all festivals except the
red-letter days still observed, together with ‘Magdalen’
(July 22), for which a collect, epistle, and gospel are
supplied. St Matthias is placed at Feb. 24.</p>

<p>The Kalendar of the Second Prayer Book of Edward VI
(1552) differs from that of the First Prayer Book, by
omitting St Mary Magdalene and St Barnabas (June 11):
but this latter would seem to have been omitted only <i>per
incuriam</i>, as the collect, epistle, and gospel are found in
the body of the book; and by the insertion of the following
black-letter days, St George (April 23), Lammas (Aug. 1),
St Lawrence (Aug. 10), St Clement (Nov. 23), together with
Term days, ‘Dog days,’ ‘Equinoctium’ (March 10) and
the days of the entrance of the sun into the several signs
of the zodiac. It is an interesting problem how in the
Prayer Book, which represents emphatically the action
of the more thorough-going of the Protestant party, these
black-letter days came to be inserted.</p>

<p>In the Prayer Book of 1559 ‘Barnabe Ap.’ reappears;
the astronomical notes are somewhat fuller, and the hours
of the rising and setting of the sun at certain dates are
recorded.</p>

<p>As regards the black-letter days in the present Kalendar
of the Church of England we have first to call attention
to the Latin Prayer Book issued by the authority of
Elizabeth in April 1560. It seems to have been ready for
the press as early as Aug. 11, 1559. Its Kalendar is adorned
with a great crowd of black-letter saints; and there are
but few days blank. In 1561 appeared a new Kalendar
in English, the work of Ecclesiastical Commissioners acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
upon a royal letter. The Commissioners were directed to
peruse the order of the lessons throughout the year, and
to cause some new Kalendars to be imprinted, ‘whereby
such chapters or parcels of less edification may be removed,
and others more profitable may supply their rooms.’ As
a matter of fact the Commissioners went beyond their
instructions, and inserted in the Kalendar the names of
black-letter saints almost as they were a century later
approved by Convocation in 1661. These were inserted
in the later issues of Elizabeth’s Prayer Book.</p>

<p>After the accession of James I the Birth-Day of Queen
Elizabeth ceased to appear in the Kalendar at Sept. 7,
and St Enurchus takes its place.</p>

<p>The only changes made in 1661 were the addition of
Ven. Bede (May 27), St Alban (June 17), and the continuance
of St Enurchus (Sept. 7), together with the
shifting (probably through mistake) of St Mary Magdalene
from July 22 to July 21.</p>

<p>With regard to the date of St Mary Magdalene a
reference to the photo-zincographic facsimile of the Black-Letter
Prayer Book, in which corrections were made at the
last revision, will show at once how easily the scribe who
copied from this book might make the mistake.</p>

<p>St Enurchus, who had appeared in this form of the
name in the Prayer Book of 1604, and still earlier in the
Kalendar of the <i>Preces Privatae</i> (which had been issued,
as <i>Regia authoritate approbatae</i>, in 1564), is obviously a
faulty form, arising from an error of transcription, for
St Euurtius. The first letter <i>u</i>, after the initial <i>E</i>, was
read as <i>n</i> (the confusion of <i>u</i> and <i>n</i> is one of the most
frequent of the errors of copyists), and the <i>ti</i> (in a manner not
surprising to those familiar with sixteenth century script)
was apparently read as <i>ch</i>. It may be added that Bede
and Alban had also appeared in the Kalendar of the <i>Preces
Privatae</i>. We have stated that St Enurchus appears in
the Kalendar of the Prayer Book of 1604, and it was
introduced then as the only addition to the black-letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
saints of the Kalendar of 1561. It is perhaps impossible
to account for its introduction; but the conjecture has
been offered that it was inserted to fill the gap caused
by the omission of the Nativity of Queen Elizabeth which
had formerly occupied Sept. 7<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.</p>

<p>The above are not the only errors of our present
Kalendar. The revisers of 1661 added explanatory
comments to the names of the saints, and in doing so
have sometimes blundered. Thus they found ‘Cyprian’
at Sept. 26, and they added ‘Archbishop of Carthage and
Martyr.’ If they had taken the trouble to look at the old
Sarum or York Kalendars they would have seen that the
Cyprian commemorated on this day was the converted
magician of Antioch. This error is probably to be traced
to Cosin’s <i>Devotions</i> (1627).</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the black-letter saints of the
modern English Kalendar form by no means an ideal
presentation of the worthies and heroes of the Church
Catholic. The Bishop of Salisbury (J. Wordsworth) has
some admirable remarks on the future reform of our
English Kalendar in his <i>Ministry of Grace</i> (pp. 421-425).</p>

<p>Certain errors in the placing of the Golden Numbers
in the Kalendar of the Prayer Book of 1662 for the month
of January were soon discovered. They are noticed in
Nicholl’s <i>Commentary on the Book of Common Prayer</i>
(1712).</p>

<p>Among the red-letter days of 1662 were ‘King Charles.
Martyr’ (Jan. 30), ‘King Charles II. Nativity and Restoration’
(May 29), ‘Papists’ Conspiracy’ (Nov. 5). These
days have the authority of the Act of Uniformity of 1662,
all of them appearing in the Book annexed to the Act.
On the authority of a Royal Warrant (Jan. 17, 1859), the
legal sufficiency of which has been questioned, these days
have ceased to be entered in the Kalendars of modern
Prayer Books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be added that the Kalendar of the Scottish
Prayer Book of 1637 (known commonly, though not
correctly as ‘Archbishop Laud’s Prayer Book’) exhibited,
in addition to the black-letter saints of the English Prayer
Book of the day, the following national or local commemorations:—David,
King, Jan. 11; Mungo, Bishop, Jan. 13;
Colman, Feb. 18; Constantine III, King, March 11;
Patrick, March 17; Cuthbert, March 20; Gilbert, Bishop,

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> It may interest the English student to be given a sketch of
the principal features of the Sarum Breviary and Missal in relation
to the subject of the festival. At Mattins the first three lessons
are from Isaiah (lv. 1-5, 6-12; lx. 1-7), speaking of light, and
the calling of the Gentiles. The versicle after the 1st lesson is
‘and the nations, shall walk in thy light, and kings in the brightness
of thy rising.’ The response and versicle after the 2nd lesson
touch on the gifts of gold and incense from Saba; ‘the kings of the
Arabs and of Saba shall bring gifts’; and this note is sounded
again and again. The 4th, 5th and 6th lessons are from a sermon
of St Leo, and the responses and versicles relate to the visit of the
Magi. In the response and versicle to the 7th lesson the baptism
of Christ is recounted; and subsequently there are several references
to the baptism. The collect is solely confined to the thought of the
revelation of God’s only begotten Son to the Gentiles by the guiding
of a star; and this is the dominant (though not exclusive) feature
of the rest of the service. During the octave the baptism is given
greater prominence; and on the octave itself the miracle at Cana
has an important place, as well as the baptism. In the Missal
the propers are confined to the revelation to the Gentiles and the
visit of the Magi. But on the octave and the Sunday within the
octave the baptism of Christ forms the leading thought.</p>
